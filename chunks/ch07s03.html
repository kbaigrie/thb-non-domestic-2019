                                       form part of the calculation of energy performance in the SBEM calculation
                                       tool (refer to clause 6.1.1). Heat loss through such junctions, if poorly
                                       designed and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> can contribute significantly to the overall heat

            </p>
            <p>As fabric insulation levels improve, the rate at which heat is lost by air
                                       infiltration through the building envelope (air permeability) becomes
                                       proportionally greater. For example, in a typical 1960&#8217;s building with
                                       poorly fitted windows 20% of the total heat could be lost through air
                                       infiltration. If the same building was upgraded to 2002 levels of fabric
                                       insulation but no attempt was made to improve the air permeability then the
                                       heat loss through infiltration could represent over 40% of total heat
                                       losses. When addressing infiltration, the provision of adequate,
                                       controllable ventilation is essential if both energy efficiency and good
                                       indoor air quality are to be achieved.

            <p>Where a balanced and practical approach is taken to reducing energy demand
                                       in new buildings, a consistent and good level of fabric insulation will
                                       limit heat loss through the building envelope. Column (a) of the table below
                                       sets out robust backstop values for the thermal performance of building
                                       elements.
            </p>
            <p>Localised areas of the same type of element may be designed to give
                                       poorer performance. These in turn will need to be compensated by the rest of
                                       the element being designed and built to a more demanding level. An example
                                       of this would be a meter box set into an <a class="link" href="apa.html#external_wall">external wall</a> or a roof void access
                                       hatch. These areas should not be any worse than the figures given in column
                                       (b) of the table below. Repeating thermal bridges (e.g. timber studs in a

                                       envelope. To limit this heat loss a separating wall cavity should have

                                       loss and result in lower carbon dioxide emissions. This can provide
                                       flexibility when applying the methodology used to meet the TER for carbon
                                       dioxide emissions (see Standard 6.1).

                                       quality and condensation unless this is addressed through the appropriate
                                       ventilation strategy. Accordingly, where very low design infiltration rates
                                       are proposed, additional measures may be needed to ensure the air quality
                                       under Section 3 Environment.

            <p>Similarly, work to improve an existing building which includes measures
                                       which reduce infiltration should also consider the impact of such work on
                                       condensation risk and moisture movement within affected construction
                                       elements (see clause 6.2.12).

            <p>A building that was originally designed to be unheated has, in most

                                       introduction of heating to such buildings will, if not accompanied by fabric
                                       insulation, result in disproportionate heat loss and wasteful use or fuel
                                       and power.

            <p>Where such a building is converted or heating is introduced to a building
                                       that was previously designed to be unheated, the building should achieve a
                                       level of performance similar to those for an extension to the insulation

                                       upon investigation of the traditional construction, form and character of
                                       the building in question and the applicability of improvement methods to
                                       that <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>.
                                       Provisions under other legislation (e.g. planning consent for listed <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> or those
                                       within conservation areas, where there is a need to maintain character, form
                                       or features) are also relevant. The manner in which proposed improvements
                                       may affect moisture movement or the permeability of existing constructions
                                       will also require assessment to address the risk of adverse
                                       consequences.
            </p>
            <p>For all <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>, it would be advisable to consider the feasibility of
                                       upgrading fabric to at least the <a class="link" href="apa.html#u_value">U-values</a> given in column (b) in clause
                                       6.2.11 (individual element U-values). In many cases, specialist advice will
                                       help ensure that, in improving energy efficiency, there is no other, adverse
                                       effect to the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> fabric.
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, each <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> will have to be dealt with on its own merits.
                                       Improvements to the fabric insulation of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> will often depend on factors
                                       such as whether or not improvement <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> can be carried out in a
                                       non-disruptive manner without damaging existing fabric (for example,
                                       insulating the ceiling of an accessible <a class="link" href="apa.html#roof_space">roof space</a>), or whether potential
                                       solutions are compatible with the existing construction.
            </p>
            <p>In certain cases, <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> are given historic or listed status because of
                                       specific features present in certain parts of the building. In these
                                       circumstances, it may be possible to make greater improvements to other less
                                       sensitive areas.
            </p>
            <p>In all cases the &#8216;do nothing&#8217; approach should not be considered initially.
                                       Innovative but sympathetic and practical solutions to energy efficiency,
                                       which are beyond the scope of this guidance, can often result in an
                                       alternative package of measures being developed for a building. For example,
                                       carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced without affecting <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> fabric
                                       through improvements to the heating system (refer to Standards 6.3 and 6.4),
                                       the lighting system (refer to Standard 6.5) or incorporation of low carbon
                                       equipment (such as biomass boilers, heat pumps or CHP). Consultation on such
                                       matters at an early stage with both the verifier and the planning officer of
                                       the relevant authority is advised.

            <p>Other than for large extensions where Standard 6.1 applies, measures to
                                       limit energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions rely primarily upon the

                                       lesser specification as is sometimes the case for conversions and
                                       alterations. The exception to this is at the junction between existing and
                                       new building work, for example the need for proprietary metal &#8216;wall starter&#8217;
                                       ties where the existing brickwork stops and new cavity blockwork begins.
                                       However other <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> standards should still be met with regard to such

                                       3.5W/m&sup2;K.
            </p>
            <p>There are no limits imposed on U-values for display windows (refer to
                                       clause 6.2.2).

            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Reconstruction of elements</strong></span> - where
                                       the build-up of an element forming part of the insulation envelope is to be
                                       altered or dismantled and rebuilt, the opportunity should be taken to
                                       improve the level of thermal insulation.
            </p>
            <p>Column (a) of the table to clause 6.2.11 gives benchmark U-values and in
                                       many cases these can be achieved without technical risk, within the
                                       constraints of the existing construction. It is recognised however that
                                       certain constructions are easier to upgrade than others and these values
                                       should be met as far as is reasonably practicable.
            </p>
            <p>A building that was in a ruinous state should, after renovation, be able
                                       to achieve almost the level expected of new construction. It may not however
                                       be reasonably practicable for a building to have its internal space
                                       significantly reduced in area or height in order to accommodate insulation,
                                       or for excessive enabling alterations to be caused by the fitting of
                                       external thermal insulation, unless the owner/occupier of the building
                                       intends that these changes are to be made. Other building standards and the
                                       impact that they will have when upgrading thermal insulation should be taken
                                       into account.
            </p>
            <p>In the majority of cases however after an alteration of this nature to the
                                       insulation envelope, a roof should be able to achieve at least an average
                                       U-value of 0.35W/m&sup2;K and in the case of a wall or floor, 0.70W/m&sup2;K.
