            <p>European Directive 2014/61/EU is intended to reduce the cost of rolling

                                       standard and guidance implements Article 8 of the Directive 2014/61/EU,
                                       which requires Member States to ensure that newly constructed buildings are
                                       equipped with a &#8220;high-speed-ready in-building physical infrastructure&#8221; to
                                       facilitate the cost-effective installation of cabling providing a minimum
                                       broadband speed of 30 Mbps.

                                       routing of ducting should be designed to suit the technology (including
                                       cabling) that is, or may be expected to be, available to the building.
                                       Horizontal ductwork through external walls should slope downwards to the
                                       outside to prevent the possibility of water ingress and be fitted with
                                       suitable temporary seals at both ends, to allow easy access for cable
                                       installation.
