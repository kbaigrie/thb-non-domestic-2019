            <p>An inclusive approach to design should be taken to ensure that <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> are as
                                       accessible to as wide a range of people as possible. Solutions should be
                                       integral to a design rather than an afterthought added in order to meet
                                       duties under building standards or other legislation.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Inclusive design</strong></span> is not just relevant
                                       to buildings. It applies throughout any internal or external environment,
                                       wherever people go about everyday activities. It should be a continuous
                                       process, through all stages of the development of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and involve
                                       potential users. Advice on this topic is available in the joint BSD/Scottish
                                       Executive Planning Division Planning Advice Note PAN 78: &#8216;Inclusive Design&#8217;
                                       which promotes the merits of an inclusive approach to the design of the
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">built</a>
                                       environment.
            </p>
            <p>All those that are involved in the design of <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> should be aware of their
                                       responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010, further details of which can
                                       be found in clause 4.0.1.

                                       in manoeuvring. It should provide a degree of traction that will minimise
                                       the possibility of slipping. This should take into account both anticipated

            </p>

                                       building. However care should be taken to ensure that the form of such a
                                       door does not present any additional hazard or barrier to use.
            </p>
            <p>Powered doors should be controlled by either an automatic sensor, such as
                                       a motion detector, or by a manual activation device, such as push-pad. Any
                                       manual control should be located at a height of between 750mm and 1.0m above
                                       ground level and at least 1.4m from the plane of the door or, where the door
                                       opens towards the direction of approach, 1.4m from the front edge of the
                                       open door leaf. A manual control should contrast visually with the surface
                                       on which it is mounted.
