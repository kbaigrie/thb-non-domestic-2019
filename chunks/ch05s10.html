                                       the valve. The discharge pipe should have an air-break, such as a tundish,

                                       recommends that, to prevent the development of Legionella or similar
                                       pathogens, hot water within a storage vessel should be stored at a
                                       temperature of not less than 60&ordm;C and distributed at a temperature of not
                                       less than 55&ordm;C. Detailed guidance on the control of Legionella may be found
                                       in HSE Approved Code of Practice L8 &#8211; &#8216;Legionnaires&#8217; Disease &#8211; Control of

                                       with increase in temperature and with extent of contact.
