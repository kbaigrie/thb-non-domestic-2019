            <p>Enclosed shopping centres can be extremely complex to design. There are
                                       large fire loads and large numbers of people all within a complicated series
                                       of spaces where most people only know one way in or out.

                                       1.8m wide. However the designer of the shopping centre should take account
                                       of localised areas where the occupancy levels will be higher than in other
                                       parts of the shopping centre. In such cases, a wider exit would be
                                       appropriate in those parts of the shopping centre. In addition, it is
                                       recommended that the entrances accessible to the general public are designed
                                       with the greatest <a class="link" href="apa.html#escape_route">escape route</a> width as evacuees will tend to use the access and
