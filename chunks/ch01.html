               <p>This is one of two Technical Handbooks, one covering <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic

                                          Handbooks have been issued by Scottish Ministers for the purpose of
                                          providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of the
                                          provisions of the building regulations under a notice given in accordance
                                          with Section 4(2) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. Each Handbook has
                                          eight sections. Section 0, this section, is identical in both Handbooks. It
                                          covers general issues and sets out how and when the regulations apply to
                                              <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> and

               </p>
               <p>The 2013 Edition of the Handbooks are being published electronically and
                                          are available free on the Scottish Government, Building Standards Division
                                          website. 
               </p>
               <p>Sections 1 to 7 give guidance on how to achieve the standards set by the
                                          regulations, and there are different sets for <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                                                 buildings</a> and non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a>. The seven sections
                                          each cover a number of related standards. They are:
               </p>
               <p>Section 1 Structure</p>
               <p>Section 2 Fire</p>

               <p>Section 4 Safety</p>
               <p>Section 5 Noise</p>
               <p>Section 6 Energy</p>
               <p>Section 7 Sustainability</p>
               <p>Each of the seven sections consists of an introduction and then general
                                          guidance on the standards within the section. This is followed by each
                                          standard which has specific introductory information and guidance on how to
                                          comply with the standard. At the end of the Handbook, after Section 7, there
                                          are the following two sections:
               </p>
               <p>Appendix A: Defined terms.</p>
               <p>Appendix B: List of standards and other publications.</p>
               <p>The Technical Handbooks are supported by a Procedural Handbook, published
                                          separately, which clarifies the intent of the Building (Scotland) Procedures
                                          Regulations 2004. A separate procedural guidance document for Crown <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> has also
                                          been produced.

               <p>This Technical Handbook gives guidance on achieving the standards set in
                                          the Building (Scotland) Regulations. The standards themselves can be found
                                          in schedule 5 to regulation 9, and are in the form of &#8216;expanded functional
                                          standards&#8217;. That is, the standards describe the functions a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> should
                                          perform, such as &#8216;providing resistance to the spread of fire&#8217;.
               </p>
               <p>The Building (Scotland) Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers are
                                          subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament. The content of the
                                          regulations, so far as it relates to technical specifications, is also
                                          scrutinised by the European Commission (EC). The EC checks with all the
                                          other countries that have adopted the <a class="link" href="apa.html#construction_products_directive">Construction Products Regulations</a> (CPR) to ensure that no
                                          barriers to trade in <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> products are created, either directly or indirectly
                                          by the way products are described.
               </p>
               <p>To meet the requirements of the CPR, materials and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> methods
                                          must be described by use of suitable European Standards wherever these
                                          exist. As there is a rolling programme of change to these National and
                                          European Standards, which includes conversion to, and the further provision
                                          of, ENs and harmonised ENs, the Handbooks have been designed to be readily
                                          updated. An explanation of the relevance and status of specific European and
                                          British standards referred to in the Handbooks is in the section concerned.
                                          There is also a list of the publications referred to in the Handbooks
                                          provided in Appendix B.
               </p>
               <p>The arrangement of Sections 1 - 7 within the Handbooks relates directly to
                                          the Basic Works Requirements of the CPR (as published by the EC), which
                                              <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>

               <p>The building regulations are enforced through the building standards
                                          system that is established by the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The Act sets
                                          out the enabling powers that allow the Scottish Ministers to make, not only
                                          the building regulations, but also procedural regulations, fees regulations
                                          and the other supporting legislation needed to operate the system. The
                                          system is designed to ensure that new <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> and <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a> achieve the objectives of <a class="link" href="apa.html#the_act">the Act</a> in terms of
                                          health, safety, welfare, convenience, conservation of fuel and power, and
                                          sustainable development.
               </p>
               <p>The roles of those operating the building standards system are explained
                                          in detail in the guidance on the procedural regulations. Briefly, the duty
                                          to comply with the building regulations lies with the owner, or in some

               <p>For some simpler <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a>
                                          a warrant is not required (see regulation 5 and schedule 3), but the
                                          regulations still apply. The owner or client again has the duty to comply.
                                          The role of issuing warrants and accepting completion certificates rests
                                          with verifiers, enforcement is by local authorities, and the system is
                                          overseen and updated by the Building Standards Division (BSD).  BSD forms
                                          part of the Scottish Government and acts on behalf of, and is responsible
                                          to, Scottish Ministers. These bodies are further explained in the guidance
                                          to the procedural regulations.
               </p>
               <p>The building standards system is pre-emptive, ensuring so far as possible
                                          that the proposed <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a>
                                          will comply with the regulations. It recognises that proposals can change
                                          during <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>, so there are requirements for amendments to the
                                          proposals to be agreed and recorded. On completion, the owner or client must
                                          certify that the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a>
                                          have been <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> in accordance with the building warrant and the
                                          building regulations. The verifier will make reasonable inquiry to ensure
                                          the completion certificate is accurate before accepting the certificate.
                                          Usually an inspection of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a> will be made, and on most projects some inspection of
                                              <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> in progress
                                          will also have been carried out. However verifiers cannot inspect all
                                          materials and <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> on
                                          every <a class="link" href="apa.html#building_site">building
                                                 site</a>. It is the client that should put in place the contractual
                                          and practical arrangements needed to assure themselves that the desired
                                          quality of <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> has been

               <p>The regulations are mandatory, but the choice of how to comply lies with
                                          the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> owner.
                                          This Technical Handbook has been issued by Scottish Ministers, through the
                                          Building Standards Division, for the purpose of providing practical guidance
                                          with respect to the building regulations. If the guidance is followed in
                                          full then this should be accepted by the verifier as indicating that the
                                          building regulations have been complied with. However it is quite acceptable
                                          to use alternative methods of compliance provided they fully satisfy the
                                          regulations.
               </p>
               <p>Failure to comply with the Technical Handbook does not render a person
                                          liable to civil or criminal procedures, but proof of compliance with the
                                          guidance may be relied on in any proceedings as tending to negative
                                          liability for an alleged contravention of the building regulations.
               </p>
               <p>Following the advice in the Technical Handbooks is therefore likely to be
                                          the normal way of complying with the building regulations. However, a
                                          designer may put forward other ways of meeting the regulations, in the form
                                          of alternative solutions.

               <p>The use of expanded functional standards, backed up by detailed guidance,
                                          provides a flexible system of control. Consideration of alternative
                                          solutions is assisted by the expansion of the functional standards
                                          previously used in the building standards regulations to clarify the
                                          necessary properties of each <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. The need for a formal
                                          relaxation of standards is reduced as meeting the full details of given
                                          solutions is no longer mandatory. The professional judgement of the
                                          verifier, assisted by guidance on questions referred to Scottish Ministers,
                                          through the Building Standards Division, decides whether a standard is
                                          met.
               </p>
               <p>In considering alternative solutions, however it is necessary to have
                                          regard to the details of this guidance. Where performance standards or
                                          policy statements are given, every part of the solution is expected to meet
                                          them. As a result, alternative solutions that appear suitable may not be
                                          acceptable in detail. For example, some of the solutions offered in relation
                                          to the English and Welsh building regulations, in the &#8216;Approved Documents&#8217;
                                          (ADs), are not suitable because the levels of thermal insulation recommended
                                          are not the same. Similarly different approaches are taken to the control of
                                          fire size and the design of <a class="link" href="apa.html#compartment">compartmentation</a> which means that <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructions</a> meeting
                                          the AD on fire safety may not be acceptable. This will vary in time as both
                                          ADs and the Scottish Technical Handbooks are updated. Solutions based on
                                          other documents, such as British or European Standards, will have to be
                                          carefully evaluated to see if the Scottish standards are being met in an
                                          appropriate manner.

                                          It is not expected that the standards will change regularly as these are set
                                          in the building regulations and can only be changed with Parliamentary
                                          approval. Therefore it is anticipated that the guidance will be replaced
                                          more regularly than the standards themselves.

               <p>Section 0 is arranged to follow the actual regulations. This sub-section
                                          provides an introduction to the building standards system. Sub-section 0.2
                                          covers regulations 1 and 2 which are the citation, commencement and
                                          interpretation. Sub-sections 0.3 to 0.15 cover the significant technical
                                          regulations with each sub-section setting out and discussing the regulation
                                          with the same number (sub-section 0.3 covering regulation 3 etc.).
                                          Regulation 16 establishes which regulations cannot ever be relaxed by
                                          Scottish Ministers. These are the regulations on citation and commencement,
                                          interpretation, exempted buildings, <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> not requiring a warrant and the
                                          methods of measurement. Regulation 17 was introduced in 2007 to help with
                                          the implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.

               <p>Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act
                                          2003, approve schemes for the certification of design or <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> for
                                          compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are
                                          approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take
                                          account of the need to co-ordinate the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> of various designers and specialist
                                          contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under
                                          the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills
                                          and experience required to certify compliance for the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> covered by the scope of the scheme.
                                          Checking procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or
                                          installation reliability in accordance with legislation.
