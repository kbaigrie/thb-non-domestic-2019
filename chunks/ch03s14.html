            <p>Fire-fighting operations depend on a sufficient supply of water in order
                                       to control fire growth and assist in effective rescue operations.
            </p>
            <p>The fire and rescue service should be provided with a water supply to
                                       assist with their fire-fighting and rescue operations. This is normally
                                       provided from public water mains through fire hydrants or alternative water
                                       supplies such as tanks or reservoirs may be provided.
            </p>
            <p>In some cases, the existing water supply may be sufficient and there is no
                                       need to provide additional water supplies. Therefore, it is important to
                                       consult the fire and rescue service and water authority early in the design
                                       process to establish what water supply, if any, should be provided in order
                                       to carry out their statutory duties under the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 as
                                       amended.

            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Performance criteria</strong></span> - a hydrant
                                       should be connected to a water service pipe capable of delivering water at a
                                       flow rate of at least 1500 litres per minute, provided by a water main
                                       vested in a public water authority or a supply provided under the Fire
                                       (Scotland) Act 2005 as amended. Alternative arrangements, including private
                                       supplies, should be agreed with the verifier and water authority, where
                                       relevant.
            </p>
            <p>Whilst it is desirable to achieve 1500 litres per minute flow rate, it is
                                       accepted that the flow rates in the water mains may not achieve this.
                                       Localised areas throughout Scotland may not be supplied by mains water or,
                                       where mains water is available, the pressure and flow rates in the main may
                                       not be sufficient for fire-fighting operations. Skilled pump operators can
                                       regulate the water supplies to the fire-fighters and take care not to
                                       overdraw the mains especially where the mains pressure and flow rates are
                                       poor.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Portable pumps</strong></span> - in some cases, where
                                       there are insufficient water hydrants distributed around existing <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>, it is
                                       normal practice to deploy portable pumps to relay water supplies to where
                                       the water is needed. Whilst this method of water distribution is quite
                                       common, it should be avoided for new developments because of the time delay
                                       in supplying water to the fire-fighters.
