               <p>Noise is unwanted sound. In order to limit the effects of unwanted sound
                                          the standards intend to improve the resistance of <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> elements to sound transmission.
                                          Research has presented clear evidence that noise can indirectly contribute
                                          to a range of health issues such as stress and anxiety.
               </p>
               <p>Inadequate sound insulation can impair health by allowing noise from other
                                          people to disrupt normal life. A number of people in <a class="link" href="apa.html#residential_building">residential
                                                 buildings</a> complain of noise made by others. The World Health
                                          Organisation has established a relationship between noise exposure and sleep
                                          disturbance however the next-day or long-term effects are still not
                                          clear.

               <p>The purpose of the standards in Section 5 is to limit the transmission of
                                          sound to a level that will not threaten the health of occupants from sound
                                          transmission emanating from attached <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> and a differently occupied part
                                          of the same <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. They also cover sound from within the same <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> if occupants
                                          are in <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">rooms</a> where they
                                          would expect to have some degree of peace and quiet.
               </p>
               <p>It is important to recognise that the standards will not guarantee freedom
                                          from unwanted sound transmission. The standards aim to limit the effects
                                          from sound created from normal domestic activities, but not from excessive
                                          noise from things such as power tools, audio systems inconsiderately played
                                          at high volume or even raised voices.
               </p>
               <p>The standards do not address environmental noise through the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> facade from
                                          sources such as aircraft, trains, road traffic or industry. Other
                                          legislation covers these areas and further information may be obtained from

                                          elements in conjunction with the main separating elements. An example of a

               <p>When sound waves strike a wall or floor, the pressure variations cause the
                                              <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> to
                                          vibrate. A portion of the vibrational energy on the sound source side will
                                          be transferred through the wall or floor where it is radiated as airborne
                                          sound on the other side. There is a loss in sound transmission as the
                                          frequency of the incident sound (sound waves produced from striking against
                                          a wall or floor for example) increases. This also varies with the direction
                                          of the sound waves, and is usually assumed to be the average for all
                                          possible angles of incidence.

               <p>Impact sound is sound that is spread from an impact or vibrational source
                                          in direct contact with a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> element such as a floor. A structural vibration is
                                          transmitted from the point of impact through the structure causing vibration
                                          leading to the radiation of sound into an adjacent <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a> below. In a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> this is
                                          commonly caused by an object hitting the floor, from where the vibration is
                                          transferred into the structure. Usually the vibration path will lead to the
                                          ceiling and perimeter walls below. The amount of impact sound heard below
                                          will depend upon many factors including the force of the impact, the

                                          detailed, flanking transmission can equal, or even exceed, sound levels
                                          perceived as a result of direct transmission. Flanking transmission can
                                          occur, for instance, when a wall abuts the face of the inner leaf of an
                                          external cavity wall, and the walls are insufficiently tied or bonded
                                          together, thus allowing the noise to travel along the inner leaf.
