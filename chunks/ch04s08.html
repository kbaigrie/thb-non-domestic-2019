            </p>
            <p>The guidance should also be used for all pipework connecting to a private

                                       to a combined sewer. This will facilitate the upgrading of the combined
                                       sewer at a later date.

            <p>Differences in plumbing within Europe have led to a variety of systems
                                       being developed. These have happened as a result of differences in the type
                                       and use of sanitary appliances in Member States. The European Standards
                                       describe the 4 main systems in use but it is expected that traditional
                                       practices will continue in the various countries. However care will need to
                                       be taken if different systems are used to ensure that the entire system
                                       operates satisfactorily and that the system designed and installed is
                                       compatible with, and suitable for, connection to existing <a class="link" href="apa.html#wastewater">wastewater</a>
