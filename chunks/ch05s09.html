            <p>This standard covers several unrelated safety issues that do not lend
                                       themselves to inclusion in other standards although glass and <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> do figure
                                       prominently.
            </p>
            <p>Collision or entrapment accidents result in a significant numbers of
                                       deaths and injuries to people in and around <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> every year. The majority of
                                       these accidents occur during normal use and involve <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> features
                                       such as doors, windows and areas of fixed glazing, with the risk of injury
                                       increased where vulnerable glass is involved. Collisions with <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> are very common
                                       as it can, if transparent, be difficult to see and may create confusing
                                       lighting effects, presenting particular difficulties for a person with a
                                       visual or cognitive impairment.
            </p>
            <p>Falls still result in deaths and serious injury to people while cleaning
                                       windows. Whether windows are cleaned professionally or by the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> owner,
                                       provision should be made to permit <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> to be cleaned safely.
            </p>
            <p>Where ventilation is provided by openable windows or rooflights, people
                                       may encounter difficulty and a hazard may arise in using these items where
                                       controls are poorly sited. Similarly, location of electrical sockets,
                                       switches and other controls can, if not considered, affect safe and
                                       convenient use.
            </p>
            <p>Roof <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> continues to
                                       be an activity with a high accident rate. Almost 1 in 5 <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> deaths
                                       occur in this sphere of work. Roof <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> therefore should be recognised as a
                                       high-risk activity and high safety standards should be actively promoted by
                                       all those who are involved. Casual roof access should be discouraged but
                                       where access is provided, such as for inspection and maintenance, this
                                       should ensure safe access, giving protection against falls. Use of fragile
                                       roof materials should be discouraged wherever possible.

                                       should be followed.
            </p>

                                       2011. All guarding should be permanently fixed and should not be detachable
                                       to permit windows to open. Guarding should be designed so that it is not
                                       easily climbable by young children unless their presence of within the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is precluded.
