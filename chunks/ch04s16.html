            <p>Condensation can occur in heated <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> when water vapour, usually
                                       produced by the occupants and their activities, condenses on exposed <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> surfaces
                                       (surface condensation) where it supports mould growth, or within <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> elements
                                       (interstitial condensation).
            </p>
            <p>The occurrence of condensation is governed by complex interrelationships
                                       between heating, ventilation, moisture production, <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> layout and properties of
                                       materials. Condensation need not always be a problem, for example it
                                       regularly occurs on the inner surface of the outer leaf of a cavity wall
                                       which receives very much more water from driving rain. However excess
                                       condensation can damage the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> fabric and contents and the
                                       dampness associated with mould growth can be a major cause of respiratory
                                       allergies.
            </p>
            <p>Condensation can also affect thermal insulation materials as the measured
                                       thermal performance reduces with increased moisture content. For all of the
                                       above reasons the control of condensation is an important consideration in
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design
                                       and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Condensation can occur in non <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a> for many of the same
                                       reasons it occurs in <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic building</a> and the similar
                                       guidance to the standards may be appropriate. There are also <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> designed
                                       and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> for
                                       specialist activities, controlled environments or factory processes that
                                       normally involve intended high humidity levels. The design of these <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> is
                                       generally by specialists and often involves distinctive <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> methods
                                       and materials required to produce <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> that are fit for purpose under
                                       the known conditions.
            </p>
            <p>The effects of climate change may exacerbate problems of condensation
                                       in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> due to
                                       higher relative humidity. Higher winter temperatures combined with increased
                                       vapour pressures could result in more severe problems, particularly in roof
                                       spaces. Very careful consideration of the issues is essential and the
                                       correct detailing will therefore be critical.

            <p>The fundamental principle of designing to control humidity is to maintain

                                       input and ventilation rate. The thermal and vapour properties of the

            <p>Section 8.4 of BS 5250: 2002 provides guidance on the control of
                                       condensation in the principal forms of roof <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>. Clause 8.4.1 of BS 5250
                                       lists various issues that should be considered in the design of roofs to
                                       reduce the possibility of excess condensation forming that might damage the
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and
                                       endanger the health of the occupants. However cold, level-deck roofs, should
                                       be avoided because interstitial condensation is likely and its effect on the
                                       structure and insulation can be severe and many instances of failure in such
                                       systems have been recorded. It is considered that more reliable forms of
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>
                                       are available. Both the warm deck and warm deck inverted roof <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructions</a>, where
                                       the insulation is placed above the roof deck, are considered preferable.
                                       However fully supported metal roof finishes including aluminium, copper,
                                       lead stainless steel and zinc are regularly used in <a class="link" href="apa.html#convert">conversion</a>

                                       have a ventilated air space on the cold side of the insulation in addition
                                       to a high performance vapour control layer near the inner surface. Further

            <p>Thermal bridging occurs when the continuity of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> fabric is
                                       broken by the penetration of an element allowing a significantly higher heat
                                       loss than its surroundings. These &#8216;bridges&#8217; commonly occur around openings
                                       such as lintels, jambs and sills and at wall/roof junctions, wall/floor
                                       junctions and where internal walls penetrate the outer fabric. Thermal
                                       bridges provide a ready passage of heat transfer to the outside air and
                                       allow a heat flow entirely disproportionate to their surface area resulting
                                       in excessive heat losses. Condensation may occur on the inner surfaces that

                                       Detailing should be in accordance with the recommendations in Section 8 of
                                       BS 5250: 2002. Also, to maintain an adequate internal surface temperature
                                       and thus minimise the risk of surface condensation, it is recommended that
                                       the thermal transmittance (U-value) of any part and at any point of the
                                       external fabric does not exceed 1.2W/m<sup>2</sup>k.

            <p>For the control of condensation in roofs, including cold deck roofs, BS
                                       5250: 2002 provides guidance on the principal forms of <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>. There
                                       is evidence that suggests that condensation in cold deck <a class="link" href="apa.html#flat_roof">flat roofs</a> is a
                                       problem. They should be avoided therefore because interstitial condensation
                                       is likely and its effect on the structure and insulation can be severe. Many
                                       instances of failure in such systems have been recorded and it is considered
                                       that more reliable forms of <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> are available. However fully

                                       steel and zinc are regularly used in conversion <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a>, and they should have a ventilated
                                       air space on the cold side of the insulation in addition to a high
                                       performance vapour control layer near the inner surface. Further information
                                       may be obtained from the relevant metal associations.

            <p>Both the warm deck and warm deck inverted roof <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructions</a>, where the insulation is
