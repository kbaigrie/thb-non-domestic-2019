            <p>The incorrect installation of a heating appliance or design and
                                       installation of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#flue">flue</a>
                                       can result in situations leading directly to the dangers noted above.
            </p>
            <p>The installation of mechanical extract fans is not in itself dangerous but
                                       guidance on their use has been included under this standard as their use
                                       with <a class="link" href="apa.html#open_flued_appliance">open-flued
                                              appliances</a> can cause problems. Extract fans lower the pressure in
                                       a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and this
                                       can cause the spillage of combustion products from <a class="link" href="apa.html#open_flued_appliance">open-flued
                                              appliances</a>. This can occur even if the appliance and the fan are
                                       in different <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">rooms</a>.
                                       Combustion appliances therefore should be capable of operating safely
                                       whether or not any fan is running (see clause 3.17.8).
            </p>
            <p>Biomass as a solid fuel comes in different forms with the most common
                                       being woody biomass which can be used in a wide range of appliances such as
                                       individual <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a> heaters
                                       to large scale heating boilers and combined heat and power (CHP) generation
                                       plants.
            </p>
            <p>Wood burning appliance technologies are such that modern appliances are
                                       now designed to efficiently burn specific wood fuel types including logs,
                                       wood chips, wood pellets and wood thinnings.
            </p>
            <p>Guidance that is given for solid fuel appliance installations may also be
                                       appropriate for biomass appliance installations however depending on the
                                       complexity of the system there may additional issues to consider
                                       particularly in relation to safety, noise, flue sizing, ventilation and fuel
                                       storage.
            </p>
            <p>There is other legislation that relates to gas fittings, appliances,
                                       installations and their maintenance and to the competency of persons who

                                       serviced carefully to ensure that the entire installation operates safely.
                                       Oil-firing equipment should be suitable for its purpose and the class of oil
                                       used in the installation. Oil-firing equipment should comply with the
                                       relevant OFTEC standard and should be installed in accordance with the
                                       recommendations in BS 5410: Parts 1 and 2.
