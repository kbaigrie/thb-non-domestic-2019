            <p>Protective barriers are necessary to prevent people in and around <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> from an accidental fall at an
                                       unguarded change of level.
            </p>
            <p>In assessing the type of barrier to be used, the likely hazards, the use
                                       of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and
                                       the risks to the people that may be present should all be considered. Any
                                       barrier should minimise the risk of persons falling or slipping through gaps
                                       in the barrier. 
            </p>
            <p>Young children are often adept at climbing anything within their reach. It
                                       is important that the design of protective barriers restrict the ability of
                                       young children to climb them, thereby reducing the possibility of injury
                                       from falls.

                                       child could pass through or that can be easily climbed. Those responsible

                                       assessing the suitability of these barriers. Where children could be in the
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> the assessment should consider

            <p>In the interests of safety, protective barriers should be provided where
                                       there is a sudden change in level and the possibility of severe injury from
                                       a fall.
            </p>
            <p>At a change of direction on an access route, a drop of any height can be a
                                       hazard, particularly to a wheelchair user or a person with a visual
                                       impairment. A protective barrier should be provided both where a significant
                                       drop occurs and in locations where a smaller change of level may increase
                                       the risk of injury.
            </p>
            <p>It is not practical to provide a barrier at every change in level, but a
                                       protective barrier for pedestrians should be provided at the edge of:

            <p>However there is no need to provide a protective barrier in a location
                                       which would block an intended access route or be incompatible with the
                                       normal use of an area, such as to the edge of a loading bay or theatre

            <p>To ensure a person can be aware of the presence of a protective barrier it
                                       should, unless forming part of a wall or partition, contrast visually with

                                       given in clause 4.8.2 should be followed.

                                       enough to permit a child to pass through. To ensure this, openings in a
                                       protective barrier should prevent the passage of a 100mm diameter sphere. 
            </p>
            <p>A protective barrier should be designed and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> so that it cannot be easily climbed by young
                                       children. The provision of potential hand and footholds should be minimised. 
            </p>
            <p>The likelihood of children being present should be accepted for all
                                           non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a> other

                                       as health and safety restrictions. In these <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>, where there are valid reasons for the preclusion of
                                       children, the above guidance on openings and potential hand and footholds
                                       within the protective barriers need not apply.

                                       be precluded from specific parts of <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>, for example, where access is solely to or within a

                                       than 100mm between a rise in a stair and the lowest edge of a protective
                                       barrier, provided the lowest edge of the barrier is not more than 50mm
