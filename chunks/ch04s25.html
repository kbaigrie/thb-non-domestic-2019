            <p>Oil is a common and highly visible form of water pollution. Because of the
                                       way it spreads, even a small quantity can cause a lot of harm to the aquatic
                                       environment. Oil can pollute rivers, lochs, groundwater and coastal waters
                                       killing wildlife and removing vital oxygen from the water. Large quantities
                                       of water are taken from rivers and groundwater for use as drinking water and
                                       for irrigation. Oil contamination can make water unfit for these
                                       purposes.
            </p>
            <p>Oil accounts for about a third of all reported pollution incidents in
                                       Scotland that are investigated by SEPA each year. That means around 500 to
                                       600 pollution incidents a year with about 10 to 12% being serious. It is an
                                       offence to cause pollution and courts now impose heavy fines.
            </p>
            <p>Oil is a &#8216;List I&#8217; substance within the meaning of the EC Groundwater
                                       Directive (80/68/EEC). The UK government is required by this directive to
                                       prevent List I substances from entering groundwater and to prevent
                                       groundwater pollution by List II substances.
            </p>
            <p>The storage of oil is a controlled activity under the Water Environment
                                       (Controlled Activities)(Scotland) Regulations 2005 and will be deemed to be
                                       authorised if it complies with The Water Environment (Oil Storage)(Scotland)
                                       Regulations 2006. Enforcement is by SEPA.

            <p>It is necessary for a wide variety of possible hazards to be considered as
                                       to whether a catchpit (bund) is required or not. BS 5410: Part 1: 1997
                                       highlights 2, as the size of the tank and its proximity to a watercourse.
                                       However other potential hazards should be borne in mind and a risk
                                       assessment should be carried out for each installation. It is preferable for
                                       installers to keep a record of this and OFTEC Technical Book 3 provides a
                                       simple crosscheck. The full list of potential hazards listed by OFTEC are:

            <p>In order to best exploit the advantages achieved through the use of woody
                                       biomass as low carbon technology it is recommended that wood fuel storage
                                       provision is of a size that will ensure bulk deliveries need not be made at
                                       intervals of less than 1 month.
            </p>
            <p>Deliveries of wood pellets may be less frequent than deliveries of wood
                                       chips because pellets can have 3 times the calorific value of dry wood
                                       chips. Alternatively, the storage volume can be smaller for the same energy
                                       capacity.

                                       help with initial studies. A more systematic exercise should be carried out
