            <p>Standard 6.1 focuses on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions arising
                                       from the use of heating, hot water, ventilation and lighting in new
                                       buildings and large extensions. The guidance sets an overall level for
                                       maximum carbon dioxide emissions in buildings by use of a methodology which
                                       incorporates a range of parameters that influence energy use. This means a
                                       designer is obliged to consider energy performance as a complete package
                                       rather than looking only at individual elements such as insulation or boiler
                                       efficiency - a &#8216;whole building approach&#8217; to energy, which offers a
                                       significant degree of design flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>For the majority of new buildings, Standard 6.1 has the greatest influence
                                       on design for energy performance. Standards 6.2 to 6.6 and 6.10, in the
                                       main, recommend benchmark and backstop levels to be achieved for individual
                                       elements or systems. To achieve compliance with Standard 6.1, it will be
                                       necessary to improve upon some or all of these backstop levels, or
                                       incorporate additional energy performance measures, such as low carbon
                                       equipment (LCE).
            </p>
            <p>The guidance given in support of Standards 6.2 to 6.8 for extensions
                                       and alterations should be followed when designing stand-alone buildings of
                                       less than 50m<sup>2</sup>.

            <p>The Simplified Building Energy Model (SBEM) is a calculation tool
                                       which forms part of the UK National Calculation Methodology which conforms
                                       with Article 3 of <a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:153:0013:0035:EN:PDF" target="_top">Directive 2010/31/EU</a> on the Energy Performance of Buildings. It
                                       is approved for use in carbon dioxide emissions calculations. SBEM has a
                                       basic user interface, iSBEM, which includes Scottish compliance parameters
                                       for use with this guidance and is available on the National Calculation
                                       Methodology website (<a class="link" href="http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/index.jsp" target="_top">http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/index.jsp</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Other tools may be used with the methodology (such as dynamic simulation
                                       modelling), particularly where the building is considered to be a complex
                                       design. A list of approved calculation tools can be found on the <a class="link" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/Building/Building-standards/techbooks/sectsixprg" target="_top">'Section 6 software'</a> page of the Building Standards Division

                                       tool but the principles and procedures also apply to other calculation
                                       tools. Designers should be familiar with the NCM and their chosen software
                                       tool and be able to explain the input and calculation process in the context
                                       of the information submitted as part of the building warrant.

                                       actual building by the designer:

            <p>The zone by zone approach allows designers greater flexibility, assigning
                                       the mechanically ventilated or cooled specification only to those zones
                                       where such solutions are proposed or required in an otherwise
                                       heated/naturally ventilated building. This sets a TER which is moderated by
                                       a less heavily serviced strategy, encouraging buildings with a reduced
                                       overall energy use and carbon dioxide emissions.

            <p>The following table outlines the standard notional building zone
                                       specifications for fabric and fixed building services, depending on the zone
                                       conditioning strategy. Some elements are further varied based upon the

                                           20kg/m<sup>2</sup>/annum are due to electrical energy
                                       consumption without power factor correction, the provision of correction
                                       equipment to achieve a power factor (pf) of 0.95 would enable the BER to be
                                       reduced by 20 x 0.025 = 0.5kg/m<sup>2</sup>/annum. The
                                       revised BER would then be 59.5kg/m<sup>2</sup>/annum.

            <p>Where, rather than making a staged warrant application, a new <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> shell and
                                       fit-out are the subject of separate <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> warrant applications, the final
                                       specification of building systems may not be known. However it remains
                                       important to ensure that such a building, if intended to be heated or cooled
                                       (other than by heating provided solely for the purpose of frost protection)
                                       will still be <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> to limit carbon dioxide emissions.
            </p>
            <p>In such cases, the calculation methodology should still be used to show
                                       that the building shell, as proposed, can comply with Standard 6.1. This
                                       should be done by identifying an example specification for any uninstalled
                                       services needed for occupation and use of the building and using this in the
                                       calculation. This specification should:

            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>be compatible with the intended building end use and servicing
                                                            strategy. Assessment should be based upon the most energy
                                                            intensive solution associated with the proposed building use
                                                            (e.g. that a shell building for commercial/office will be air
                                                            conditioned), and

            <p>A TER/BER comparison can then be carried out. In specifying the building
                                       shell, reference should be made to the maximum U-values and air-tightness
                                       levels identified in clauses 6.2.4 and 6.2.6.
            </p>
            <p>Whilst the NCM will assess shell and fit-out installations on a
                                       zone-by-zone basis, full details of the example specification, identifying
                                       uninstalled services, should form part of information with the building
                                       warrant and should identify, in particular, any installed low carbon
                                       equipment proposed to meet the Target Emissions Rate. This will provide
                                       information to any party considering subsequent fit-out work on the expected
                                       level of performance of remaining building services needed to demonstrate
                                       compliance of the finished building prior to occupation.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Use of continuing requirement</strong></span> - where
                                       Standard 6.1 applies to a building, the verifier can issue a continuing
                                       requirement with a building warrant for a shell building. This will mean
                                       that the subsequent fit-out, whether subject to a building warrant or not,
                                       demonstrates that the final building also complies with Standard 6.1 by
                                       having calculated emissions which do not exceed the TER declared for the
                                       shell building. In demonstrating this, the same edition of the NCM used for
                                       the shell building calculation may be used for the BER calculation for the
                                       final building. 
            </p>
            <p>This will also result in the production, under Standard 6.9, of an Energy
                                       Performance Certificate on completion of the final building. This must be
                                       produced using the edition of the NCM which is current at the time works are
                                       completed. 
            </p>
            <p>Dependant upon the final specification of the building, additional
                                       provisions may be needed to meet the carbon dioxide emissions standard at
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>
                                       fit-out phase. Accordingly, those involved in the further development of a
                                       shell <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> are
                                       advised to consider early assessment of the building, as constructed, to
                                       determine the extent to which such provisions may be needed at
                                       fit-out.
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, when considering either separate building warrants for shell
                                       and fit-out or a single, staged warrant, an early assessment of the
                                       implications each route may have on the design and specification of the
                                       initial <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is
                                       recommended.
