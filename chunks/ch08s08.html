                                       directly relevant to the design function of the building, as well as
                                       identifying strategies for key rooms such as classrooms, sports halls,
                                       libraries or community rooms outlining their overall heating lighting and
                                       ventilation strategies. This will allow a greater understanding on
                                       controlling their internal environment in an efficient manner.&nbsp; It should be

            <p> The information within the user information guide should be concise and
                                       compact and presented where possible with graphics to aid rapid
                                       comprehension. Utilising this approach therefore means it is more likely to
                                       be kept available, used for future reference and represented as new pupils
                                       are introduced to a school. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>The guide should be accessible to all, using diagrams and coloured
                                       presentations. Information should be available in digital format to allow it
                                       to be made available as a digital booklet and able to be stored online on a
                                       central server perhaps to be used as a mobile application, a digital
                                       information board or server screen savers or part of a home screen where
                                       Wi-Fi is available. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>Key classrooms that are likely to be used for community or public
                                       functions such as, sports halls, libraries or community rooms should have a
                                       permanent display to inform occasional users on how to operate the building
                                       effectively.  &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>The emphasis is to provide the information as a digital booklet. Where
                                       printed copies are required, the recommended formats should be as a
                                       booklet.

            <p> The guide should include plans, locating key items of equipment and
                                       information only on the systems installed. The format should revolve around
                                       simple illustrations following the principle &#8211; &#8216;show don&#8217;t tell&#8217;. An
                                       illustration can be a hand-drawn sketch, a computer image or a photograph.
                                       These can be mixed because consistency in style is less important than
                                       content.  Illustrations do not need to be to scale, but should show
                                       relationships and explain things quickly and easily. These guidelines should

                                       Cover the main principles of use in both warm and cold weather. Simple
                                       diagrams illustrating how the individual teaching space is heated and cooled
                                       in both winter and summer are useful. Avoid engineering heating system

                                       Supplementary heating sources should be mentioned, where included. Provide a
                                       brief description of how heat reaches rooms e.g. radiators, under floor
                                       heating, air grilles, with illustrations provided as required. Briefly
                                       describe how heating is controlled. Illustrations and locations are required
                                       for all the main controls. Identify the reaction to heating controls (for
                                       example there may be a time lag before a heating system operates at optimum
                                       capacity) and outline the normal range if this is not obvious. &nbsp;

                                       diagrams illustrating how the teaching space is ventilated in winter and
                                       summer are useful. Briefly describe how the ventilation is controlled with
                                       illustrations and locations required for all the main controls. This should
                                       include both natural and mechanical systems. Identify the elements that

                                       trickle vents and opening of windows together with a reference to cross
                                       ventilation. For mechanical ventilation it may be the boost switch and

                                       water panels). Consider a simple diagram illustrating how the system works
                                       if it has a number of components or options. Briefly describe how hot water
                                       generation is controlled. Illustrate the controls, identify the reaction to
                                       hot water controls (for example there may be a time lag before a hot water
                                       system operates at optimum capacity) and outline the normal range if this is
                                       not obvious.  &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>e) Natural and Artificial Lighting</p>
            <p>Provide up to 50-100 words on a how teaching space is lit both naturally
                                       and artificially. For natural daylight, a simple diagram illustrating how
                                       the effects the sun may have, in both the summer and winter (or bright or
                                       overcast days) including any solutions to reduce glare. Describe how manual
                                       or automatic controls for artificial lighting can reduce the likelihood of
                                       artificial lights being used when they are not required.&nbsp; Briefly describe
                                       how any manual artificial lighting is controlled as well as illustrating
                                       their location. &nbsp;
            </p>
            <p> f) Other Energy Saving Features (if installed) </p>
            <p>Cover any other energy saving feature installed as part of a passive
                                       strategy to heat light or cool a building. Include instructions for items
                                       not covered elsewhere. Each item should have a brief (around 50 words)
                                       description of other energy saving features. Identify for each item:
