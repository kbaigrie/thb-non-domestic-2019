                                       no water services or plumbing element under proposed works, there is no need
                                       to consider improvement to insulation of vessels and work to circulatory
                                       elements to wet heating systems). The intent of this is to avoid the need to
                                       engage specialist contractors that are not already involved in a project.
                                       However, the applicant may broaden the scope of improvements considered if
                                       they choose to (for example, where the applicant considers such improvements
                                       to be more relevant to the building in question).

            <p>Improvement should be proportionate to the extent of proposed works. It is
                                       recommended that the cost of improvement works should amount to
                                       approximately <span class="bold"><strong>5%</strong></span> of the cost of proposed
                                       work. In this respect, assessment should be based upon cost of carrying out
                                       improvement works, exclude any design or consultancy fees. Where proposed
                                       improvements amount to less than this percentage, the applicant should, in
                                       scheduling the assessment process, provide evidence to support any reduced
                                       level of improvement.
            </p>
            <p>It is the intent that improvement works proposed should be cost-effective,
                                       with a short to medium payback period. Assessment need only consider
                                       improvements that, when combined, have a payback period of <span class="bold"><strong>five years </strong></span>or less. The exception to this is the
                                       replacement of a boiler or chiller unit, where near the end of its useful
                                       life, as there will be additional cost benefit where replacing such
                                       equipment as part of more extensive works.
            </p>
            <p>The cost of any improvement works should be included in the estimated
                                       value of works used to determine the level of building warrant fee. The
                                       value of improvement works and proposed works should be identified
                                       separately to allow the proportion of improvement works to be
                                       verified.
            </p>
            <p>Work to improve fixed building services should be neither overly

                                       extensive intervention to the building fabric. However, it is recognised
                                       that work chosen by the applicant (see clause 6.D.4) may be of such a
                                       nature. Where such enabling work is required, it should not be counted as
                                       part of the cost of improvement work.

            <p>To deliver improvements that are both cost-effective and relevant to the
                                       building being assessed, the types of improvement taken forward should be
                                       determined by the person responsible for the building (the relevant
                                       person/applicant) in consultation with any appointed agent or consultant.
                                       Recognising the complexity of the existing building and its systems,
                                       assessment should be carried out by persons with the necessary expertise to
                                       identify and assess cost-effective and energy efficient improvement.
            </p>
            <p>The intent of the Direction is to deliver cost-effective improvement to
                                       the performance of the existing building services. Applicants should be
                                       aware that it is therefore in their best interests for existing fixed
                                       building services to be examined and assessed, to enable the most effective
                                       and beneficial improvements to be identified for consideration.
            </p>
            <p>As noted in clause 6.D.2, whilst specific fixed building service issues
                                       are identified, the applicant may propose alternative improvements where
                                       they consider these more relevant to the building and can demonstrate that
                                       such improvement will deliver broadly equivalent benefit.
            </p>
            <p>Where an Energy Performance Certificate or similar assessment exists for
                                       the building, it would be good practice to check any recommendations on
                                       existing fixed building services amongst the cost-effective improvements
                                       already identified.
            </p>
            <p>For buildings with air conditioning systems, applicants should be aware of
                                       the need for inspection of systems over 12kW under regulation 17 of the
                                       Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 and, where applicable, should consider
                                       instructing such an inspection where such systems are present. Information
                                       from this report will assist in assessing potential improvement to such
                                       systems under this Direction.
            </p>
            <p>To maximize benefit to the building, improvements should meet current
                                       performance levels recommended in the guidance to Standards 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
                                       and 6.6 where this is reasonably practicable. Where not reasonably
                                       practicable, for technical reasons or for reasons of cost or level of
                                       disruption to the building, improvement should still be made to the extent
                                       that can be achieved. The applicant should take advice on the impact which a
                                       lower level of improvement may have on the cost effectiveness of such work
                                       and may choose to not make such improvements where payback periods are
                                       longer than five years. The case for this should be presented to the
                                       verifier.

                                       services are of a scale appropriate to the proposed works or, if not, that

            <p>Whilst the verifier may question the extent of proposals and request
                                       further evidence to support such enquiries, it is not expected that they
                                       should direct the types of improvement which are to be carried out for a

            <p>On acceptance of proposals by the verifier, works arising under this
                                       Direction are subject to the same process as all other works requiring a
                                       building warrant, where the responsibility of the relevant person/applicant
                                       is to carry out works in accordance with the issued building warrant and the
                                       requirements of the building regulations in general. The verifier will make
                                       reasonable enquiry to establish this, prior to accepting a completion
                                       certificate.

            <p>Due to the checking integral to the building warrant process, the local
                                       authority should generally have no direct role in this process other than as
                                       verifier. However, under section 25 of the Act, the local authority may
                                       serve a building regulations compliance notice on the building owner, if the
                                       improvement work is not carried out. Where the building owner fails to

            </p>

                                       (post 4 March 2002) need not be improved further where the minimum

                                       recent and relatively energy efficient as this will generally be less

                                       a new staff room. The estimated value of the new work is &pound;50,000. Proposed
                                       works include power, lighting, heating and ventilations systems. The
                                       capacity of the existing boilers is sufficient to cater for the heating and
                                       hot water requirements of the extension. The building already has an EPC

            </p>
            <p>In this case, the building owner is advised that the saving from combining
                                       daylight sensors and T5 retrofit would be reduced (as sensors would act to
                                       improve a lighting load already reduced by the T5 retrofit) and, having
                                       experienced increased heating bills over recent years, elects to improve the
                                       performance of the heating system instead of installing sensors. On that

                                       recommendations that will improve performance.

            <p>Following on from further assessment of the fixed building services in the
                                       existing building, the following improvement measures are identified:

            <p>The first option (installation of T5 retrofit kits) is above
                                       the 5% cost and the payback period (in isolation) is long. The third option
                                       (installation of variable speed drives), while within the identified 5% cost
                                       margin, has an unrealistically long payback period which would not make it a
                                       suitable choice for improvement.
            </p>
            <p>The remaining improvement item has a short payback period and amounts to
                                       less than 5% of the proposed value of works. The recommendations to improve
                                       the air conditioning systems are low cost but would contribute to assessment
                                       under the Direction.
            </p>
            <p>The building owners choose to implement the second option (replacing GLS
                                       with CFL) which has a short payback period and a high annual fuel cost
                                       saving, even though the initial cost is below the identified 5% works cost.
                                       They also identify improvement to the air conditioning system and the small
                                       cost this incurs. As works remain below the identified 5% works cost,
                                       evidence is provided to show that no other cost-effective improvements are
                                       applicable to the building. Proposed work and evidence of further assessment
                                       carried out are scheduled as part of the submission to the verifier.
