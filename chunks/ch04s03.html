            <p>Radon is a naturally occurring, radioactive, colourless and odourless gas
                                       that is formed where uranium and radium are present. It can move through
                                       cracks and fissures in the subsoil, and so into <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>. The amount, or activity, of
                                       radon is measured in becquerels (Bq).  Where this gas occurs under <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>, the <a class="link" href="apa.html#external_wall">external walls</a>
                                       contain it and the containment of radon can build up inside the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> over the
                                       long term posing a risk to health.
            </p>
            <p>Exposure to high levels of radon for long periods increases the risk of
                                       developing lung cancer. To reduce the risk, all new <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>, extensions

                                       built in areas where there might be radon concentration, may need to
                                       incorporate precautions against radon.

            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999</strong></span>
                                       - Occupational exposure to natural radiation sources, including radon gas,
                                       is the subject of regulatory control. This is in line with the most recent
                                       revision to the Euratomic Basic Safety Standards Directive (Council
                                       Directive 96/29/EURATOM) that establishes a common basis for radiation
                                       protection legislation in all European Member States. Regulation 3 of the
                                       Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/3232) sets a national
                                       reference level for radon gas in workplaces of 400
                                           Bq/m<sup>3</sup> averaged over any 24 hour  period. An
                                       employer or self-employed person responsible for a workplace is required to
                                       measure radon levels in the workplace on being directed to do so.
            </p>
            <p>If radon levels are found to be in excess of the reference level, the
                                       regulations require that measures be taken to safeguard the health of
                                       workers.
            </p>

                                       worked on detailing mapping in Scotland of radon potential. The report
                                       providing an overview of this work, titled "Indicative Atlas of Radon in
                                       Scotland", was published in July 2011 and is available to view or download
                                       from the PHE&#8217;s &#8220;UKradon&#8221; website at <a class="link" href="http://www.ukradon.org/" target="_top">http://www.ukradon.org/</a>. The

                                       immediately adjoining a <a class="link" href="apa.html#site">site</a>, should have radon gas made safe so that it is not allowed
                                       to be contained in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> at levels that are considered harmful to health. The
                                       term &#8216;ground immediately adjoining&#8217; is intended to cover ground that is
                                       disturbed as a direct result of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Workplaces are less of a risk than <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> because, generally speaking,
                                       people spend less time at work than at home and workplaces usually have
                                       better ventilation provision.
            </p>
            <p>Large <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> tend to be mechanically ventilated and this may result
                                       in the dilution of radon gas. The action level of 400
                                           Bq/m<sup>3</sup> in work places makes it easier to stay
                                       within that level than the lower level of 200
                                           Bq/m<sup>3</sup> for <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a>.
