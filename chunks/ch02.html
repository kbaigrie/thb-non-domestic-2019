                                          the Health and Safety Executive to maintain a continuing review of <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and civil
                                          engineering matters affecting the safety of structures. The prime function
                                          of SCOSS is to identify in advance those trends and developments that might
                                          contribute to an increasing risk to structural safety. The collation and
                                          dissemination of information relating to matters of structural concern is a
                                          vital element of achieving safe structures. SCOSS has established a UK wide
                                          confidential reporting system (CROSS) to gather data on structural
                                          problems.

                                          Frequently, <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design procurement will involve the appointment of a
                                          number of designers who may be employed by more than one organisation.
                                          Detailed design of individual structural details and components can be
                                          passed to specialist contractors. In these circumstances the client should
                                          appoint a lead designer or other appropriately experienced and qualified
                                          person to oversee the design process.

                                          should take account of all of the factors identified in clause 1.0.2 above.
                                          For example, care should be taken where alternative numerical values are

                                          of application has been produced. Withdrawal of a standard implies that

                                          five-year review by a BSI committee to consider the currency of the standard

                                          private events. They include grandstands, tents and marquees that can

                                          A collapse of such a structure can have serious consequences. These
