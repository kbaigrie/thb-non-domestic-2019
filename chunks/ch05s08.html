            <p>There are many situations within a building, where a means of clear
                                       communication needs to be ensured.
            </p>
            <p>A variety of hearing enhancement systems are commonly used within <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> including
                                       induction loops, infrared and radio transmission systems. The type of system
                                       and performance sought should be considered at an early stage in the design
                                       process.
            </p>
            <p>Hearing enhancement systems are important in locations where an audience
                                       will normally be present, where intelligibility of a sound source can be
                                       compromised by distance or reverberation, in locations where a physical
                                       barrier exists between speaker and listener and where information will be
                                       sought.
            </p>
            <p>Designers and <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> operators should also be aware of the benefits that the
                                       use of temporary and portable hearing enhancement solutions can offer to a
                                       wider range of situations, outwith those listed in guidance.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Conversions</strong></span> - in the case of <a class="link" href="apa.html#convert">conversions</a>, as
