            <p>Silage effluent is the most prevalent cause of point source water
                                       pollution from farms in Scotland. A high proportion of serious pollution
                                       incidents occur each year through failure to contain or dispose of effluent
                                       satisfactorily.
            </p>
            <p>Collection, storage and disposal of farm effluent and livestock wastes are
                                       all stages when pollution can occur. These materials are generally
                                       classified by type of stock and physical form. This may be solid, semi-solid
                                       or liquid. Solids are stored in dungsteads that must be properly drained and
                                       the effluent collected in a tank while liquids are stored in tanks above or
                                       below ground. The container must be impermeable.
            </p>
            <p>The guidance to this standard should not be read in isolation. Appropriate
                                       sections of other legislation, such as the Control of Pollution (Silage,
                                       Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and The Water
                                       Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2011, as amended
                                       would also normally require to be met. The Scottish Environment Protection
                                       Agency is the body responsible for enforcing these environmental regulations

                                       Pollution from Agricultural Activity is a practical guide for farmers,
                                       growers, contractors and others involved in agricultural activities, on whom
                                       there is a statutory obligation to avoid causing pollution to the
                                       environment. The Code provides helpful guidance on the planning, design,
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>,
                                       management and land application of slurries and silage effluent that can
                                       give rise to pollution of water, air or soil environments. SEPA is the body
                                       responsible for enforcing these regulations.
