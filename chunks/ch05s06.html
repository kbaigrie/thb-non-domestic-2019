            <p>Extra-low voltage is defined as not more than 50 volts alternating current
                                       or 120 volts direct current, measured between conductors or to earth. This
                                       might include installations for alarm or detection purposes, or for
                                       transmission of sound, vision, data or power.
            </p>
            <p>Any such installation should be designed, <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a>, installed and tested such
                                       that it is in accordance with the recommendations of BS 7671: 2008.

                                       voltage higher than low voltage should be provided with a cut-off switch for
