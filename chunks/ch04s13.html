            <p>It is important that <a class="link" href="apa.html#sanitary_facility">sanitary facilities</a> address the needs of
                                       occupants and visitors, both in terms of availability and accessibility.
                                       Facilities should be sufficient in number to prevent queuing, other than in
                                       exceptional circumstances. Variety in the range of provision will assist not
                                       only people with a mobility or sensory impairment but also benefit older
                                       people, those with babies or young children or encumbered by luggage.

                                       facilities that are small or in awkward locations, making them difficult to
                                       access and use. Common issues include screening of the facilities that
                                       results in small lobbies and the use of white finishes, <a class="link" href="apa.html#sanitary_facility">sanitary

            <p>Whilst guidance is offered on a variety of <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> types, some may not be
                                       categorised easily. In such cases, designers will need to discuss specific
                                       provision with client and user groups and consider the guidance given under

                                       need to meet the standards specified by the Changing Places Consortium
                                       (CPC). Meeting the consortium's standards will mean that registered
                                       facilities should meet the needs and expectations of the people who use them

            <p>The human body absorbs lead easily from drinking water and this can
                                       have a negative effect on the intellectual development of young children.
                                       Although mains water supplies do not contain significant levels of lead,
                                       recent research studies have shown that leaded solder plumbing fittings,
                                       normally used for heating systems, have been used on drinking water pipework
                                       in contravention of the Scottish Water Byelaws 2004. Further guidance can be

                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>, it may be impractical to
                                       provide a CPT that achieves all of the above key elements. In such cases
                                       alternative solutions, that still meet the needs of most users and their
                                       carers may be considered. Early consultation with the Changing Places
                                       Consortium will be beneficial in these cases. Further information, including
