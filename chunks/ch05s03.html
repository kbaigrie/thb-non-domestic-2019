            <p>Circulation areas within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> should allow occupants to move
                                       around freely and without difficulty, to the best of their ability. Lack of
                                       space can make movement around a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> difficult for many people and
                                       hamper activities such as carrying or moving large items.
            </p>
            <p>It is important to consider space provision and the form of access, both
                                       within and between <a class="link" href="apa.html#storey">storeys</a> and particular elements of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> that may otherwise make use of a
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>
                                       difficult for many people.
            </p>
            <p>All those involved in the design of <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> should also be aware of their
                                       responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010, further details of which can
                                       be found in clause 4.0.1.

            <p>Whilst the guidance to this standard reflects general good practice,
                                       certain issues remain outwith the scope of the building regulations. There
                                       are numerous publications offering additional guidance on accessibility and

            <p>Heavy door leafs and strong closing devices can make an otherwise
                                       accessible door impassable to many <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> users. The force needed to open
                                       and pass through a door, against a closing device, therefore should be
                                       limited.
            </p>
            <p>A door should be capable of operating with an opening force of not more
                                       than 30N (for first 30&ordm; of opening) and 22.5N (for remainder of swing) when
                                       measured at the leading edge of the leaf. Within this limit, a closing
                                       device should close the door leaf from any opening angle, against the
                                       resistance of any latch and seals, under normal operating conditions.
            </p>
            <p>Where a door across a corridor requires to be retained in a closed
                                       position, in normal use or under fire conditions, and this cannot be
                                       achieved by use of a closer alone without exceeding these opening forces, a
                                       latch should be used to retain the door in a closed position and the door
                                       fitted with operating ironmongery.
            </p>
            <p>A free swing device, which only has a closing action when activated by an
                                       alarm system, should not be fitted to a door across a circulation route as
                                       this permits the door to be left open at any angle, creating a collision

            </p>
            <p>To allow this, surfaces should be provided at two levels. For standing
                                       users, this should be within a range of 950mm to 1.1m in height. For seated

                                       recess below of at least 500mm deep and at least 700mm high and a clear
                                       manoeuvring space in front of the surface of at least 1.2m deep. The knee
                                       recess is particularly important where activities such as writing may take
                                       place, such as at a bank counter. Where depth of the surface will permit,

                                       should be installed at lower height. Where a number of similar counters are

                                       height.
