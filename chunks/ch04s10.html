            <p>The intention of this standard is to ensure that non-mains drainage
               systems are designed and constructed to a standard so that the discharges
               from them do not contribute to environmental pollution and will achieve
                                     statutory environmental standards. Subject to discharge authorisation from
                                       SEPA, (see clause 3.8.5) wastewater from treatment systems can either
                                       discharge to land via an infiltration system or to watercourses, lochs or
                                       coastal waters. The guidance to this standard deals with discharges to land
                                       via infiltration systems. The infiltration method will form a critical part
                                       of the treatment system and care must be taken in the type, design and
                                       location chosen to avoid environmental pollution. The guidance to this
                                       standard should be used in conjunction with the guidance to Standard 3.8
                                       when designing wastewater treatment systems.
            </p>
            <p>Several hundreds of wastewater treatment systems are thought to cause
                                       pollution problems every year. These problems occur mainly because of poor
                                       location, poor drainage field design or lack of maintenance.

                                       disposal method should be considered.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Second, a trial hole</strong></span> should be dug to
                                       determine the position of the water table and soil conditions. This trial
                                       hole will enable the sub-soil type to be determined. The trial hole should
                                       be a minimum of 2m deep, or a minimum of 1.5m below the invert of the
                                       proposed distribution pipes. The trial hole should be left covered for a
                                       period of 48 hours before measuring any water table level. Subsoils that
                                       overlay bedrock allow water to move through the pore spaces between the
                                       grains of material of which they are composed. They are the first line of
                                       defence against pollution and act as a protecting filtering layer. Where
                                       these materials are unsaturated, pollution attenuation processes are often
                                       enhanced. Water flows through much of Scotland&#8217;s bedrock via fissures.
                                       Attenuation of contaminants is limited in these cases. For safe and
                                       effective dispersal of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#wastewater">wastewater</a>, the groundwater and bedrock
                                       should be at least 1m below the bottom of the distribution pipes. It should
                                       also be noted that it is the seasonally highest level of the water table
                                       that should be determined for the infiltration area.
            </p>
            <p>Third, to determine the type of infiltration system and the area of
                                       ground required, percolation tests should be carried out. These percolation
                                       tests should be carried out using either of the following
                                           methods:

                                                            Next day, refill the test sections of the percolation holes with
                                                            water to a depth of at least 300mm and observe the time (t) in
                                                            seconds, for the water to seep away from 75% to 25% full level.
                                                            Divide this time by 150mm. The answer gives the average time in

            <p>However the ground strata or permeability of the soil may influence this
                                       dimension and it may be reduced slightly where the strata directs any
                                       groundwater away from the <a class="link" href="apa.html#foundation">foundations</a> or if the soil is free draining. Indeed, to preserve
                                       the structural integrity of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>, it may be prudent to increase
                                       the dimension where ground conditions would allow <a class="link" href="apa.html#wastewater">wastewater</a> to collect around the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building's</a>
                                       <a class="link" href="apa.html#foundation">foundations</a>.
