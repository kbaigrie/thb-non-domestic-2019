            <p>It is important that any outbreak of fire in premises is detected at an
                                       early stage in order that the occupants once alerted can commence evacuation
                                       of the premises as soon as possible. There should also be a means so that
                                       anyone in the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> who discovers a fire, can alert others to the existence
                                       of the fire and this should include arrangements for calling the fire and
                                       rescue service. The benefit of early warning of a fire will increase the
                                       probability of the safe evacuation of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and will assist owners and
                                       occupiers of <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> in formulating their fire safety policy and emergency
                                       fire action plan.

                                       raising the alarm could be quite simple, e.g. where a shouted warning "FIRE"
                                       by the person discovering the fire may be all that is needed. In more

                                       automatic calls received by the fire and rescue service result in
                                       unnecessary attendance due to false alarms. This is normally attributed to
                                       poor, design, installation or maintenance of automatic fire detection and
                                       alarm systems. Guidance on how to assess the risks and reduce false alarms

                                       detector should give an almost instantaneous warning from all the fire alarm
                                       sounders. However where the means of escape is based on phased evacuation,
                                       then a staged alarm system is appropriate. This enables two or more stages
                                       of alarm to be given within a particular area (e.g. alert or evacuate
                                       signals).

                                       solution which will include the fire alarm specification. Dependant on the
                                       determined use at design stage, a category L1 to L5 with or without voice
                                       alarm should be installed.

            <p>The factors that should be considered when assessing what category of fire
                                       alarm or automatic fire detection system is to be provided, will vary widely
                                       from one premises to another therefore the type of system will need to be

            <p>Fire detection and fire alarm system is a term used in this handbook to
                                       describe any type of automatic sensor network and associated control and
                                       indicating equipment. Sensors may be sensitive to smoke, heat, gaseous
                                       combustion products or radiation. Normally the control and indicating
                                       equipment operates a fire alarm system and it may perform other signalling
                                       or control functions as well. Automatic sprinkler systems may also be used
                                       to operate a fire alarm system.
            </p>

            <p>BS EN 54: Part 11: 2001 covers two types of call points. Type A (direct
                                       operation) in which the change to the alarm condition is automatic (i.e.
                                       without the need for further manual action) when the frangible element is

                                       the alarm condition requires a separate manual operation of the operating
                                       element by the user after the frangible element is broken or
                                       displaced.
            </p>
            <p>Manual call points as specified in BS EN 54: Part 11: 2001 (Type A) should
                                       be installed in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> and sited in accordance with BS 5839: Part 1:

                                       installation of a voice alarm should be considered. For example, where a

                                       to a fire warning, or where occupants are unfamiliar with the fire warning
                                       arrangements. Voice alarms systems may be used to alert staff or give a
                                       coded message explicit to those having responsibility for taking action in a
                                       fire. They can form part of a public address system and give both an audible

                                       fire. A voice alarm system should be installed to comply with BS 5839: Part
                                       8: 2008.
            </p>
            <p>The fire warning signal should be distinctive in sound from other sounds

            <p>Early warning of fire significantly increases the degree of safety
                                       provided to occupants. In order to minimise false alarms, a variation from
                                       the category L1 system may be justified regards the siting of smoke or
                                       carbon monoxide detectors in bedroom areas. Detectors are typically
                                       installed in most other <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">rooms</a> and few if any areas should be left unprotected and a
                                       category L1 or L2 system should be installed.

                                       numbers of young, excitable persons and will require a greater degree of
                                       control and stewarding than for other events which, despite attracting
                                       similar audience numbers, will have an entirely different behaviour profile,
                                       such as a play performed in a large theatre.

                                       based on risk assessment of the particular circumstances. An example would
                                       be where a country school could consist of one large classroom with 14
