               <p>Life safety is the paramount objective of fire safety. Non-domestic <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> should be
                                          designed and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> in such a way that the risk of fire is reduced and
                                          if a fire does occur, there are measures in place to restrict the growth of
                                          fire and smoke to enable the occupants to escape safely and fire-fighters to
                                          deal with fire safely and effectively.
               </p>
               <p>There are more than 3000 reported fires in non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                                                 buildings</a> every year in Scotland. The most common cause of
                                          accidental fires in non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a> is faulty appliances
                                          and leads, accounting for more than 21% of fires followed by misuse of
                                          equipment or appliances at around 11%. Statistics also show that around 39%
                                          of fires in non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a> are deliberately started. While the number of
                                          deaths from fires in non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a> is less than <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                                                 buildings</a> the potential for significant life loss and injuries is
                                          far greater. This is due to the large occupancy capacities that may be
                                          involved and the complexity of occupant behaviour including the potential
                                          for delay in occupant evacuation following the outbreak of fire.
               </p>
               <p>In the event of an outbreak of fire, it is important that the occupants
                                          are warned as soon as possible. The guidance to Standard 2.11 provides
                                          recommendations for the installation of alarm and detection systems in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> where
                                          people may be asleep or where there is a particularly high risk.
               </p>
               <p>The standards and guidance in this section are designed to work together
                                          to provide a balanced approach to fire safety. The <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> elements, materials, components
                                          or other parts of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> identified in the guidance should follow the
                                          appropriate performance levels that are recommended throughout the guidance.
                                          However where a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> element, material, component, or other part of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is covered
                                          by more than one standard, the more demanding guidance should be
                                          followed.

                                          fire and are not usually aware of the speed that fire can spread. The risk

                                          appropriate for the guidance in Section 2 Fire. For example, to establish
                                          the height of the topmost storey for fire and rescue service facilities, the
                                          height should be measured from the fire and rescue service access level and
                                          not necessarily the lowest ground level. Therefore, methods of measurement
                                          unique to fire are described within the guidance under each of the relevant
                                          standards.

                                          automatic fire detection, suppression and ventilation systems in conjunction
                                          with passive fire protection. It is reasonable to demonstrate compliance

                                          verifier and the fire authority should be consulted early in the design

                                              design assumptions. For example, the strategy should include an

                                          to be maintained and tested over the life time of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> so that they
                                          will operate effectively. BS 7974 and IFEG assume that all aspects of the
                                          fire engineering strategy are capable of being maintained and deployed over
                                          the lifetime of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. If for example, alterations are found to be necessary
                                          due to changes to the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> layout, the original strategy may need to be
                                          re-evaluated to ensure the fire safety provisions have not been compromised.
                                          For this reason, the fire strategy should preferably support any fire safety
                                          risk assessment required under Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, as
                                          amended.
               </p>
               <p>Fire safety engineering involves the use of scientific based calculations
                                          and/or statistical information to demonstrate an adequate level of safety
                                          for a specific <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>, structure or installation. In this regard the fire
                                          safety strategy is based on performance rather than prescription. Therefore,
                                          fire safety engineering is about the need to identify the fire hazard,
                                          assess the fire risks, understand the consequences and to offer fire safety
                                          strategies and designs to show how the objectives have been met. The &#8216;tools&#8217;
                                          that support fire engineering can include calculation methods, which are
                                          used to demonstrate that under a worst reasonable case, tenable conditions
                                          are maintained during the evacuation period. For example, a smoke exhaust
                                          fan in a smoke reservoir within an atrium space fails to operate but the
                                          smoke layer height continues to be maintained by the activation of a
                                          stand-by fan.
               </p>
               <p>It is recognised that fire engineering is still a rapidly developing field
                                          and as such does not have the standardised codes for approaching and solving
                                          problems compared to other engineering disciplines. The documents identified
                                          above aim to provide a structured framework for assessing the interaction
                                          between, <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>,
                                          people and fire, and to facilitate innovation in design without compromising
                                          safety. They provide information on how to undertake a detailed analysis of
                                          specific aspects of fire safety engineering in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>.
               </p>
               <p>In practice, both frameworks provide a flexible but formalised engineering
                                          approach to fire safety which can be applied to new or existing <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> to show
                                          that the functional standards have been met.

                                          surface is exposed to radiation and flames.

               <p>Local authority verifiers may accept the certification of products,
