                                       accompany each application for building warrant for a new building made on

            <p>This is relevant to systems specified in relation to Standard 6.3 (heating
                                       systems) and, where mechanical cooling is proposed, Standard 6.6 (mechanical
                                       ventilation and air conditioning) and also to use of low or zero carbon
                                       generating technologies which contribute to meeting emissions targets set
                                       under Standard 6.1 (carbon dioxide emissions).

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>This requirement has no direct implications for the design, specification
                                       and construction of new buildings and the functional standards and guidance
                                       applicable to heating and cooling systems were unchanged within the
                                       Technical Handbooks.
            </p>
            <p>Applicants are not required to use the described technologies. The purpose
                                       of this article of the Directive is to encourage awareness and consideration
                                       of such solutions.
            </p>
            <p>Whilst new buildings do not have to incorporate such technologies, the
                                       challenging standards set under Standard 6.1 (carbon dioxide emissions) do
                                       mean that they are a more common part of design solutions in energy
                                       efficient, low carbon buildings. For example, an element of PV is present in
                                       the TER calculation for new non-domestic buildings. 
            </p>
            <p>This means that a range of &#8216;high-efficiency alternative systems&#8217; will be
                                       considered as a matter of course as part of the design process for new
                                       non-domestic buildings. This process should not therefore generate a
                                       separate and detailed options analysis but will simply record the key
                                       outcomes of discussions on this topic during the design process.

                                       receipt of the statement and takes no action in respect of the content.
