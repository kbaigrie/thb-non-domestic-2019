                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a>, sold or rented out, an
                                       energy performance certificate (EPC) or a copy thereof is shown to the
                                       prospective new tenant or buyer and handed over to the buyer or new tenant.
                                       Standard 6.9 ensures the continued presence of such information for buyers
                                       and tenants by also making EPCs fixtures within <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>.
            </p>
            <p>EPCs must be produced in an independent manner and be carried out by
                                       qualified/accredited experts. With the exception of EPCs produced in
                                       relation to a building warrant applied for before 9 January 2013, EPCs must
                                       be produced by members of an Approved Organisation. Scottish Ministers have
                                       appointed a number of Approved Organisations (AO) to deliver certification
                                       services, with each AO following an Operating Framework which is published
                                       on the Building Standards Division website. Information on this framework
                                       and Approved Organisations can be found at www.scotland.gov.uk/epc (<a class="link" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/epc" target="_top">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/epc</a>).

                                       2003. The Energy Performance of Buildings (Scotland) Regulations 2008, as
                                       amended, place a duty on owners to make EPCs available to prospective buyers
                                       and tenants. There are also requirements in those regulations for display of
                                       an EPC in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> exceeding

            <p>The EU Directive allows energy performance to be reflected in one or more
                                       numeric indicators. For this to be done in a transparent manner that is
                                       meaningful in terms of Scottish building regulations, the measure to be used
                                       is carbon dioxide.

                                       with Standard 6.1. In many cases the SBEM calculation tool (<a class="link" href="http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/index.jsp" target="_top">http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/index.jsp</a>) will have been used
                                       for the new <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. However if an approved detailed simulation model has
                                       been used to comply with Standard 6.1 it is acceptable to use it to do the

                                       data should be used in preference to generic UK data.
