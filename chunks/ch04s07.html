            <p>Sustainable urban drainage (SUD) is a concept that focuses decisions about
                                       drainage on the environment and people. The concept takes account of the
                                       quantity and quality of <a class="link" href="apa.html#surface_water">surface water</a> run-off and the amenity

                                              water</a> in the urban environment.

            <p>The variety of design options available allows designers and planners to
                                       consider local land use, land take, future management and the needs of local
                                       people. SUD systems often stretch beyond the confines of the curtilage of
                                       individual <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> but need to be considered as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>Fundamental to a successful SUD system is a management train that allows
