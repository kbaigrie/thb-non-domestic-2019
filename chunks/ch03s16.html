            <p>Automatic fire suppression systems help control the intensity and size of
                                       a fire, suppress it and in some cases may even extinguish it. It can provide
                                       occupants, including vulnerable occupants, with the additional time
                                       necessary to escape following the outbreak of fire. The primary role of the
                                       suppression system may be for life safety or property protection.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Life safety</strong></span> - automatic fire
                                       suppression systems react to heat therefore, the greatest protection is
                                       afforded to those occupants outwith the <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a> of fire origin. Automatic
                                       suppression may provide some benefit to occupants in the <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a> of fire origin where
                                       for example the fire growth is fast and the temperatures allow the sprinkler
                                       system to open early in the development phase of the fire. The spray pattern
                                       delivered from the heads should control fire spread, reduce temperatures and
                                       dilute the smoke. In some cases, the fire might be extinguished if the fire
                                       is not shielded from the sprinkler spray. A smaller fire means that the fire
                                       and rescue service will be able to bring the fire under control and
                                       extinguish it much more quickly.

                                       fire have traditionally centred on life protection rather than asset
                                       protection. A primary objective of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> standards system however is to
                                       &#8216;further the achievement of sustainable development&#8217;. The sustainability of
                                       communities could be served by the protection against both deliberate and
                                       accidental fires in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> such as schools that serve as social assets and
                                       components of the local economic network. There is on average 152 fires in
                                       Scottish schools each year that result in significant costs in terms of the
                                       damage and disruption they cause.

                                       be designed, installed and maintained in accordance with the LPC Rules for
                                       Automatic Sprinkler Installation. These rules contain the text of BS EN

                                       the recommendations (e.g. Technical Bulletin 221, Sprinkler protection of
                                       schools). The suppression system should cover the entire <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> including

            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Existing schools</strong></span> - where additional
                                       accommodation is provided to an existing school by either extending the

                                       the automatic fire suppression system should be extended into the extension

            </p>
            <p>Where an existing school does not have an automatic fire suppression

                                              practicable</a> to install an automatic fire suppression system. This
                                       would be where the benefits of a system are clearly outweighed by the costs.
                                       However, the designer should check whether an automatic fire suppression
                                       system is required to satisfy any school client or insurer requirements.

                                       system all relevant factors should be taken into account. The primary
                                       consideration is likely to be the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> size and proportionate cost of
                                       the fire suppression system in relation to the overall project cost. The
                                       expected life of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is also an important factor as some <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> may only be
                                       needed for a short time. For example temporary classrooms needed for school
                                       refurbishments or other construction. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>Secondary considerations include the risk of deliberate or wilful
                                       fire-raising in the immediate geographic area, for which advice could be
                                       sought from the local fire and rescue service. There is also the potential
                                       impact of any damage or disruption caused by fire.  &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>Where an existing school is being altered, there is no need to install an

                                       building which has an automatic fire suppression system installed, it is
                                       important that the system&#8217;s operation is not compromised by any <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> work.

                                       expected. It is recognised that pressures may vary throughout the day and
                                       night, over the year and perhaps in future years. Therefore it is imperative
                                       that the system is designed on the basis of what the minimum pressure and
                                       flow is likely to be. If there is any doubt, a tank and pump arrangement
                                       should be used.
