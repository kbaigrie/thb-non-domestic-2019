            <p>Regulation 8 applies to all building work, and requires that materials,
                                       fittings and components used in the construction of buildings should be
                                       suitable for their purpose, correctly used or applied, and sufficiently
                                       durable, taking account of normal maintenance practices, to meet the
                                       requirements of these regulations. For example, external timber cladding for
                                       low-rise <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> that is readily
                                       accessible and replaceable need not be as durable as that which is to be
                                       used at a higher level on medium-rise <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>It also implements the European Regulation 305/2011/EU Construction
                                       Products Regulation (CPR), in force on 1 July 2013 that replaces the current
                                       Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC). This Regulation requires that
                                       products covered by a harmonised European product standard or conforming to
                                       a European Technical Assessment should normally have CE marking.
            </p>
            <p>The intention of the guidance below is to provide adequate flexibility to
                                       accommodate new techniques as well as proven traditional practices. This
                                       guidance ensures acceptance of products which satisfy the basic works
                                       requirements of the CPR to avoid barriers to trade. For example, products
                                       bearing a CE mark (European Mark of Conformity) must be accepted as meeting
                                       regulation requirements where the declaration of performance satisfies the
                                       requirement and the product is being correctly used. 
            </p>
            <p>Sections 1 - 7 of the Technical Handbooks are arranged to equate with the
                                       7 basic works requirements of the CPR. This should aid assessment of
                                       products against the regulation requirements. There may however be other
                                       Directives applicable to certain products or <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructions</a>.
            </p>
            <p>A verifier may only reject CE marked products if the declaration of
                                       performance does not meet the regulation requirement or the products are
                                       being incorrectly used. If the verifier rejects a product the relevant
                                       trading standards officer should be notified. This is a requirement of the
                                       CPR, and will enable the UK government, where necessary, to notify the
                                       European Commission.
            </p>
            <p>It should be noted that CE marking alone does not show compliance with the
                                       building regulations, as the CE mark may be showing compliance with other
                                       Directives or Regulations applicable to certain products or constructions.
                                       &nbsp;For example, a self contained smoke alarm, manufactured in accordance with
                                       the Electro Magnetic Compatibility Directive should be accepted as
                                       satisfying requirements only insofar as they relate to prevention of
                                       electromagnetic disturbances by, and prevention against disturbances to,
                                       such smoke alarms.

                                       any member state to allow the product onto their market and for specifiers
                                       and users to be able to assess whether the product is suitable for its
