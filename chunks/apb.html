            <p>The Construction Products Regulation (CPR), in force in the UK on 1 July 2013,
                                   permits the use of a wide range of standards and specifications recognised
                                   throughout the European Economic Area (EEA) (see Note 1). 
            </p>
            <p>Standards of safety, suitability and fitness measured against factors common
               throughout Europe are intended to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade. The
                                   European standards body (CEN), see clause 0.8.2, produce harmonised European
                                   Standards (EN) to replace the variety of standards used throughout Member States
                                   (see Note 2). These ENs have been or will be published in the UK by the British
                                   Standards Institution (BSI) as a BS EN. Once a BS EN is published, the old BS
                                   will co-exist for a transitional period (usually 1 year) with the corresponding
                                   BS. Until the BS EN comes into force during which both BS and BS EN may be
                                   referenced. At the end of the transitional period the BS is withdrawn and the BS
                                   EN must be adopted.
            </p>
            <p>The complex processes involved in the production of European Standards can
                                   create lengthy development times. European Standards in draft form are termed
                                   prEN and are released into the public domain when they are issued for
                                   consultation. It has been found necessary, occasionally, to reference prEN in
                                   the Technical Handbooks where no other suitable document yet exists.
            </p>
            <p>Any reference in the Technical Handbooks to a British Standard (BS), British
                                   Standard Code of Practice (CP), European Standard (BS EN or prEN) or
                                   International Standard (BS EN ISO) is to a standard published by BSI. Where a
                                   revision or a newer standard has since been produced, this newer version may be
                                   used as an alternative, unless otherwise stated in the handbooks. Any reference
                                   in the handbooks to a particular requirement or recommendation of such a
                                   standard should be taken, unless the context otherwise requires, as including
                                   reference to any relevant commentary and defined terminology contained in that
                                   standard. Attention is also drawn to the status accorded to standards and
                                   specifications recognised elsewhere in the EEA which provide an equivalent
                                   standard &#8211; see the guidance to Regulation 8, Materials, durability and
                                   workmanship. Compliance with the standards contained in publications in this
                                   category represent compliance with the appropriate standards referred to
                                   elsewhere in the handbooks and is acceptable until a relevant harmonised
                                   standard is introduced.
            </p>
            <p>Harmonised test methods have been agreed collectively by Member States and CEN
                                   on the basis of the implications of health and safety of the product and on the
                                   particular nature and production process for the product itself. Certification,
                                   inspection and testing of construction products is carried out by notified
                                   bodies who have been appointed for the purpose by a Member State and whose name
                                   has been notified to the European Commission. The British Board of Agr&eacute;ment
                                   (BBA) is a notified body for certain products. Any reference in the handbooks to
                                   a certificate issued by a notified body or to a BBA Certificate should be
                                   construed as reference to the current certificate.
            </p>
            <p>Any reference in the handbooks to a publication should be construed as a
                                   reference to that publication as detailed in Column 1 of the list of
                                   publications given in this Appendix, subject to such amendments, supplements or
                                   addenda as are detailed in the list.
            </p>
            <p>Where a publication referred to in the handbooks itself refers to another
                                   publication, the reference to such other publication should be considered to be
                                   a reference to the latest edition including any amendments, supplements or
                                   addenda.
            </p>
            <p>Where the standards listed in this Appendix have been amended or replaced
                                   since the publication of the handbooks, it is no longer necessary to await the
                                   publication of updated guidance. The verifier can accept a design to the new
                                   standard if it considers the relevant expanded functional standard is
                                   met.
