               <p>Within Scottish building regulations, improvements in energy standards
                                          have been made over many years, including in 2007, the move to a single
                                          carbon dioxide emission based methodology for assessing carbon and energy
                                          performance in new buildings.
               </p>
               <p><span class="bold"><strong>The Sullivan Report</strong></span> - in 2007,
                                          Scottish Ministers convened an expert panel to advise on the development of
                                          a low carbon building standards strategy to increase energy efficiency and
                                          reduce carbon emissions. This resulted in The Sullivan Report &#8211; &#8216;A Low
                                          Carbon Building Standards Strategy for Scotland&#8217; (<a class="link" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Sullivanreport" target="_top">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Sullivanreport</a>). A key recommendation of this Report was staged improvements in energy
                                          standards in 2010 and 2013, with the aim of net zero carbon buildings
                                          (emissions for space heating, hot water, lighting and ventilation) in
                                          2016/17, if practical.
               </p>
               <p>In May 2013 Scottish Ministers reconvened the Sullivan panel with a view
                                          to revisiting some of their original recommendations, taking account of the
                                          impact of the economic downturn on the construction sector. Whilst
                                          maintaining the level of ambition, the <a class="link" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/11/8593/0" target="_top">2013

                                          reductions in Scotland. The Act sets an interim target of a 42% reduction in
                                          emissions (compared to 1990) by 2020, and an 80% reduction target for 2050
                                          with annual targets set in secondary legislation. The high level measures

                                          sector has a major role to play in this respect. Emissions from the burning
                                          of fossil fuels are contributing to climate change, with energy use in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> being a
                                          significant source of such emissions. Increased energy efficiency and
                                          promotion of renewable energy are therefore an important element of
                                          Scotland&#8217;s strategy to tackle climate change.

               <p>The intention of Section 6 is to ensure that effective measures for the
                                          conservation of fuel and power are incorporated in buildings. In addition to
                                          limiting energy demand by addressing the performance of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> fabric and
                                          fixed <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>
                                          services, a carbon dioxide emissions standard obliges designers of new <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> to consider
                                              <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design
                                          in a holistic way.
               </p>
               <p>Improvements set out within this section will result in a greater need to
                                          consider the benefits which localised or building-integrated low carbon
                                          equipment (LCE) (e.g. photovoltaics, solar water heating, combined heat and
                                          power and heat pumps) can make towards meeting standards. Although the focus
                                          is primarily on lowering carbon dioxide emissions from buildings, the
                                          measures within this section are intended to reduce energy demand and
                                          continue to ensure that, for new <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> and new building work, use of
                                          energy and fuel costs arising from this are both minimised.
               </p>
               <p>Guidance also recognises issues relevant to requirements within Articles
                                          3, 4, 6-9 and 11 of the EU Directive <a class="link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:153:0013:0035:EN:PDF" target="_top">2010/31/EU</a> on the Energy Performance of Buildings (EPBD) and

                                          Establishing the thermal conductivity of materials in a building element
                                          forming part of the insulation envelope will enable the thermal
                                          transmittance of the element to be calculated.
               </p>
               <p>Measurements of thermal conductivity should be made in accordance with BS
                                          EN 12664: 2001, BS EN 12667: 2001 or BS EN 12939: 2001 (<a class="link" href="http://www.bsigroup.com/" target="_top">http://www.bsigroup.com/</a>). There are a wide range of
                                          technical publications which give the thermal conductivity of common
                                          construction materials but, where available, preference should be given to
                                          values that are certified by a <a class="link" href="apa.html#notified_body">notified</a>
                                          body. Additional guidance given in BRE publication BR 443 should also be
                                          followed.

                                          compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are
                                          approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take
                                          account of the need to co-ordinate the work of various designers and
                                          specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification
                                          services under the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the
                                          qualifications, skills and experience required to certify compliance for the
                                          work covered by the scope of the scheme. Checking procedures adopted by
                                          Approved Certifiers will deliver design or installation reliability in
