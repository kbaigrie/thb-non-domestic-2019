               </p>
               <p>The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 allows Scottish Ministers to regulate for
                                          the purpose of furthering the achievement of sustainable development. In
                                          Scotland, sustainability is embedded into the building regulations for all
                                          new buildings, rather than reference being made to new buildings achieving
                                          levels within a voluntary system. Since 2005, progress has been made by
                                          strengthening the standards on, for example, energy efficiency and
                                          accessibility for all new buildings so they are comparable with the best in
                                          Europe. &nbsp; 
               </p>
               <p>Whilst the standards within Sections 1 - 6 of the 2013 Technical Handbooks
                                          deliver a level of sustainability in a number of areas such as energy and
                                          surface water drainage, there is always the possibility of going beyond the
                                          minimum standard. Scottish Ministers consider that it is not practicable at
                                          this time to require every building to incorporate higher performance
                                          standards or further sustainability measures. However, developers may wish
                                          to gain recognition for building to higher standards. Additionally,
                                          organisations such as planning authorities or funding bodies may choose to
                                          make constructing to a higher level of sustainability a condition of
                                          approval or funding.
               </p>
               <p>Defining higher standards to measure sustainability will enable higher
                                          quality buildings to be created and for such benefits to be formally
                                          recognised. The continued development of Section 7 is the next step in
                                          encouraging the sustainable design and construction of all new buildings
                                          within a broader context of sustainable development. Further reductions in
                                          carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from new buildings
                                          will also assist in meeting targets within the Climate Change (Scotland) Act
                                          2009. &nbsp; 
               </p>
               <p>On 1st of May 2011, Sustainability labelling was introduced to the
                                          Scottish Building Standards through the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 which
                                          allows Ministers to make building regulations for the purpose of furthering
                                          the achievement of sustainable development. Applicable to all new buildings,
                                          the principles build upon the degree of sustainability already embedded
                                          within the building regulations.

                                          matters that are associated with sustainable development such as location
                                          and transport cannot be adequately delivered by the building standards

               <p>There are areas currently considered inappropriate for
                                          inclusion in the optional upper levels for new buildings due to the
                                          complexity of some subjects related to building design and construction,
                                          such as material sourcing and embodied energy. However the Sullivan Report
                                          ('A Low Carbon Building Standards Strategy for Scotland'; published by
                                          Scottish Ministers in 2007) recommends total-life zero carbon buildings by
                                          2030. This section can respond in due course to the growing relative
                                          importance of embodied energy as the performance of new buildings improves
                                          further. At present these areas are outside the scope of this standard.

               <p>Schools in particular occupy a central place within a community or
                                          neighbourhood. Therefore the concept of a &#8216;sustainable school&#8217; as a whole
                                          will reach out beyond the site boundary and include better and safer active
                                          travel routes to and from a school. It is clear that location is outwith the
                                          remit of building standards but this part of sustainable design is addressed
                                          in Scottish planning policy. The planning document &#8216;Designing Streets&#8217;
                                          contains guidance that should be applied when the connections between
                                          schools and the places they inhabit are being considered and designed.

               <p>Other tools to assess a level of sustainability for new buildings exist
                                          and are used in Scotland. These indicators may be selected as appropriate
                                          for some developments because they cover issues such as location,
                                          orientation on site, or transport that are broader than building regulations
                                          can include. Other established indicators place greater emphasis on the
                                          sourcing and embodied energy of construction materials, an area flagged up
                                          in this section for future review. Other tools could be complementary in an
                                          assessment of sustainability but they cannot be used as a method to meet an
                                          optional upper level of sustainability within building regulations.
