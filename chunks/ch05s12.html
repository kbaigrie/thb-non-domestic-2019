            <p>This guidance deals with non-domestic supply installations where liquefied
                                       petroleum gas (LPG) is stored under pressure at ambient temperatures in
                                       fixed vessels larger than 75kg LPG capacity.
            </p>
            <p>Guidance is also given on the storage of LPG within grouped cylinders,
                                       when connected to a supply installation.
            </p>
            <p>The intention of the guidance to this standard is to minimise both the
                                       risk of fire spreading to the tank and of the contents of the tank forming
                                       explosive gas pockets in the vicinity of any LPG storage container.
            </p>
            <p>All persons concerned with the storage and use of LPG should be aware of

                                       reference should be made to the relevant Part of the Code of

            <p>Where an LPG storage installation consists of a set of cylinders, the

                                       'Use of LPG cylinders': Part 1 - 'The Use of Propane in Cylinders at

            <p>Use of cylinders in such an installation commonly takes the form of 2 sets
                                       of paired cylinders connected to a manifold, with supply provided from one
                                       pair of cylinders at any one time. This allows continuous supply to be
                                       maintained when changing empty cylinders.
            </p>
            <p>Any installation should enable cylinders to stand upright, secured by
