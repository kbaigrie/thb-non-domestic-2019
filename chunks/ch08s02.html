                                       welcomed. For example, a new building could have a sustainability label at
                                       Bronze Active level, which also indicates that a Gold level has been
                                       achieved in the aspect of carbon dioxide emissions. This achievement would
                                       be clearly reflected on the sustainability label.

            <p> Optional upper levels of sustainability for a school building containing
                                       classrooms should be selected from the following, defined within clauses
                                       7.1.4 - 7.1.9: 
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>Silver or Silver Active</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>Gold</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The aim is for balance in the setting of upper levels because
                                       sustainability is considered in the round rather than focusing on issues of
                                       energy or carbon emissions. Reaching upper levels should be a valid target
                                       for any new development, regardless of size or location. Generally, levels
                                       have been set to avoid individual aspects that could upset applications
                                       which might otherwise meet all of the other aspects of sustainability. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>The first optional upper level &#8216;Silver&#8217; offers substantial benefits in a
                                       range of sustainability aspects which should be achievable by most new
                                       schools. The second optional upper level &#8216;Gold&#8217; is a more demanding target,
                                       initially aimed at those intent on pursuing best practice. 
            </p>
            <p>School buildings that exceed a Gold sustainability level are also
                                       welcomed. A third upper level called 'Platinum' has been reserved for
                                       further recognition within the building standards system. At present, only
                                       the aspect of carbon dioxide emissions has been defined for this level. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>School buildings that exceed Bronze, Bronze Active, Silver, Silver Active
                                       or Gold levels by achieving a higher level criteria in one or more of the
                                       aspects are welcome and reflected on the sustainability label. However, the
                                       achievement of the next upper level (Platinum) will only be recognised once
                                       all aspects of that particular level have been included. The award of an
                                       overall upper level depends upon meeting all aspects rather than allowing
                                       trade-offs to achieve a score, reinforcing the fact that sustainable
                                       outcomes rely on holistic integrated design. 
            </p>
            <p>The specified levels of sustainability in clauses 7.1.3 to 7.1.9 are sets
                                       of measures that are transparent to all including verifiers, planners,
                                       funding bodies, and building users.

            <p>Under the guidance to Standard 6.1, carbon dioxide emissions (Building
                                       Emission Rate) is to be 38% lower than the Target Emission Rate (TER) set by
                                       the 2015 Standards. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>To establish this, the TER from the NCM calculation should be multiplied
                                       by 0.62, to give a revised figure that the BER should not exceed. (This is
                                       equivalent to a 64.3% improvement on the 2010 Standards and a 75%
