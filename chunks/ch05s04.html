            <p>Half of all accidents involving falls within and around buildings occur on
                                       stairways, with young children and elderly people being particularly at
                                       risk. This risk can be greatly reduced by ensuring that any change in level
                                       incorporates basic precautions to guard against accident and falls.
            </p>
            <p>Stairs and ramps should be constructed to be within limits recognised as
                                       offering safe and convenient passage and designed so that any person who is
                                       likely to use them can do so comfortably and safely, with the minimum amount
                                       of difficulty. Design should also address the issue of appropriate guarding,
                                       where a level change is made, and seek to eliminate any possible trip
                                       hazards.

            <p>The act of climbing stairs can be tiring to many people. Whilst landings
                                       can provide a safe resting point, the <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> itself is not intended to do so.
                                       The maximum number of rises between landings should therefore be
                                       limited.
            </p>
            <p>Generally, a <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a>
                                       should have not more than 16 rises.
            </p>
            <p>Below a minimum number of steps, it becomes difficult to signal a change
                                       of level, which can contribute significantly to a trip hazard.
            </p>
            <p>Generally, a <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a>
                                       should have at least 3 rises.
            </p>
            <p>However people tend to take greater care at certain locations, such as at
                                       an external door, and a single step or 2 steps may be appropriate under
                                       certain circumstances. There may be less than 3 rises:

            <p>All stairs providing access to and within <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> should be designed to be
                                       accessible by most persons with reduced mobility.
            </p>
            <p>Open risers on a <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> can be a hazard. When ascending a stair, people may be at
                                       risk of trapping the toes of shoes beneath projecting nosings, and of
                                       tripping as a result. In addition, many may feel a sense of insecurity when
                                       looking through spaces present between treads.
            </p>
            <p>A stair should have contrasting nosings to assist in identifying the
                                       position of treads and risers should be profiled to minimise tripping as
                                       shown below. Open rises should not be used unless a stair is intended for
                                       descent only, such as in a dedicated <a class="link" href="apa.html#escape_stair">escape stair</a> on an <a class="link" href="apa.html#escape_route">escape

            <p>Small children can climb or fall through gaps in stair treads and the size

                                       overlap by at least 15mm. Any opening between adjacent treads in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> should be small
                                       enough to prevent the passage of a 100mm sphere.

            <p>A sudden and unguarded change of level on an access route can present a
                                       hazard to a person with a visual impairment. Therefore, on external access
                                       routes, tactile paving should be used to alert people to the presence of a
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> of
                                       steps.
            </p>
            <p>The use of &#8216;corduroy&#8217; tactile paving identifies this hazard and advises
                                       users to &#8216;proceed with caution&#8217;. It should be provided at the head and foot
                                       of any <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> of
                                       external steps, forming a strip 800mm deep, positioned 400mm from the first
                                       step edge, as noted below.
            </p>
            <p>On any landing mutual to a <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> of steps and a ramp, tactile paving should lie outwith
                                       the landing area of any ramp flight, to prevent possible confusion which
                                       might lead to injury.

            <p>The width of a ramp should relate to the intensity of use. For example, an
                                       unobstructed width of 1.8m is the minimum that will allow two wheelchair
                                       users to pass safely. As a ramp <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> will normally be enclosed between
                                       flanking handrails or guarding, it is important that this width still offers
                                       safe and convenient passage.
            </p>
            <p>The effective width of a ramp <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> should be at least 1.0m. Effective
                                       width is measured between handrails, or where there are no handrails, the
                                       protective barrier or inside face of any wall or guarding kerb, and should
                                       be clear of any obstructions.
            </p>
            <p>A ramp which forms part of an <a class="link" href="apa.html#escape_route">escape route</a> should have an effective

                                                            seating, e.g. at a balcony, and where a protective barrier is
                                                            provided as described in clauses 4.4.1 and 4.4.2.

            <p>Where fixed seating is installed, intermediate steps between tiers of
                                       seating should be positioned to minimise projection of any riser into the
                                       clearway zone at the end of each row. This may result in treads of differing
                                       lengths. A regular step rhythm should be maintained in all cases.
