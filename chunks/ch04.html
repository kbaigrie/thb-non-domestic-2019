               <p>Water, air and soil are intricately linked and all can be affected by
                                          various forms of pollution that affect our environment. Other issues such as
                                          condensation have been a constant threat to people and <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> for many
                                          years.
               </p>
               <p>Industrial change and demographic shift during the 19th and 20th centuries
                                          resulted in large-scale re-organisation of our villages, towns and cities.
                                          Industries moved out or disappeared altogether leaving large, 'brownfield',
                                          gaps in our landscape. At the same time, changes in heating methods and the
                                          advent of the consumer society, have had a significant effect on the type
                                          and volume of refuse it has been necessary to dispose of to landfill.
                                          Inevitably, these changes have left behind a legacy of land contamination
                                          that in some cases, may be harmful. The Scottish Government encourages the
                                          use of previously developed land (brownfield) and local authorities may wish
                                          to promote brownfield land in preference to greenfield land. Some of this
                                          land will be contaminated and will need to be made safe.
               </p>
               <p>Climate is controlled by the long-term balance of energy of the Earth and
                                          its atmosphere. Natural events cause changes in climate but human activities
                                          can also change the climate. The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the
                                          atmosphere due to human activities will change the climate by enhancing the
                                          natural greenhouse effect, leading to an increase in the Earth's average
                                          surface temperature resulting in heavier rainfall.
               </p>
               <p>Indoor air quality complaints are frequently associated with comfort
                                          issues: high or low temperatures, draughts, high or low humidity or poor
                                          lighting. However the incidence of real indoor pollution should not be
                                          ignored, it is surprisingly common. The <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> quality of <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> is
                                          improving with a resulting reduction of adventitious air infiltration
                                          producing fewer air changes. Inadequate ventilation, inefficient filtration
                                          and poor hygiene all contribute to poor indoor air quality.
               </p>
               <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) gas has no smell, taste or colour and it kills dozens
                                          of people in their homes every year. Many more suffer debilitating illnesses
                                          often without anybody realising that they are being poisoned. CO gas is
                                          produced by combustion appliances such as fires, boilers and water heaters.
                                          Any appliance that burns solid fuel, gas or oil and that does not have a
                                          room-sealed balanced flue so that it is sealed off from the <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a>, is capable of
                                          poisoning you if it is not properly installed, maintained and serviced. The
                                          highest incidence of CO poisoning occurs in <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                                                 buildings</a>.
               </p>
               <p>Oil accounts for about a third of all reported pollution incidents in
                                          Scotland that are investigated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency
                                          (SEPA). That means around 500 to 600 pollution incidents a year with about
                                          10 to 12% being serious. It is an offence to cause pollution and courts now
                                          impose heavy fines. Although domestic pollution is low compared with
                                          commercial and industrial <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>, it is important to ensure standards are not
                                          lowered.
               </p>
               <p>Disposal of <a class="link" href="apa.html#wastewater">wastewater</a> and <a class="link" href="apa.html#surface_water">surface water</a> also needs to be carefully
                                          considered to prevent environmental pollution and uncontrollable run-off
                                          during periods of heavy rainfall leading to flooding. The incorporation of
                                          water conservation measures in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> can reduce pressure on precious
                                          water resources by recycling water from certain types of appliance.
                                          Recycling can also reduce the reliance on mains water and limit the amount
                                          of water discharged thus alleviating the risk of flooding. The inclusion of
                                          &#8216;green roofs&#8217; into <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design can also provide benefits to the environment and

                                          alike. Although viewed as mainly a vernacular <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> practice renewed interest is
                                          being shown in this technique due to the diverse benefits that can be

                                          compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are
                                          approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take
                                          account of the need to co-ordinate the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> of various designers and specialist

                                          Checking procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or
                                          installation reliability in accordance with legislation.
