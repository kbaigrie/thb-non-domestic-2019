               <p>Safety has been defined by the International Standards Organisation as &#8216;a
                                          state of freedom from unacceptable risks of personal harm&#8217;. This recognises
                                          that no activity is absolutely safe or free from risk. No <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> can be
                                          absolutely safe and some risk of harm to users may exist in every <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. Building
                                          standards seek to limit risk to an acceptable level by identifying hazards
                                          in and around <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> that can be addressed through the Building (Scotland)
                                          Regulations.

               <p>Deaths and serious injury to people in and around <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> occur in
                                          significant numbers from accidents involving falls, collisions, entrapment,
                                          scalding, electrocution or malfunction of fittings. Designers need to
                                          consider carefully all aspects of design to minimise risks inherent in any
                                          building.

                                          of legislation (including the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and

               </p>
               <p>The Workplace, (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 cover the

                                          compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are
                                          approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take
                                          account of the need to co-ordinate the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> of various designers and specialist
                                          contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under
                                          the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills
                                          and experience required to certify compliance for the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> covered by the scope of the scheme.
                                          Checking procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or
                                          installation reliability in accordance with legislation.
