            <p>Facilities within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> are provided to assist the fire and rescue service
                                       carry out their statutory duties as efficiently and safely as possible. Fire
                                       and rescue service personnel are trained to enter <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> following the outbreak of fire
                                       to assist with any evacuation of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> occupants, effect rescues of any
                                       casualties and to fight fires. Fire-fighters operational duties are made on
                                       a statutory basis in the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 as amended, which
                                       states:

            <p>The extent of fire development will vary with each incident and in any
                                       situation, the fire and rescue service will assess the need to evacuate the
                                       entire <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>
                                       whilst the fire is brought under control. Sometimes, the fire can develop to
                                       such an extent that additional fire-fighting teams may need to be summoned
                                       from other fire stations or fire authorities.
            </p>
            <p>Fire-fighters will normally enter a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> through the main entrance and
                                       attempt to attack the fire. This is termed &#8216;offensive fire-fighting&#8217; and is
                                       normal practice regardless of whether people are in the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> or not. When
                                       conditions within the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> become too hazardous for fire-fighters to remain, they
                                       will normally retreat a safe distance away from the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and
                                       implement &#8216;defensive&#8217; fire-fighting tactics to control the spread of fire.
                                       In cases where a large fire develops, numerous fire-fighting teams may be
                                       involved using a combination of offensive and defensive tactics until the
                                       fire is brought under control and extinguished.
            </p>
            <p>Whilst fire-fighters are professionally trained to deal with all types of
                                       fire condition, the fire and rescue service facilities within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> are
                                       important to reduce fire attack time which in turn, could save lives, limit
                                       the fire damage to property and improve fire-fighter safety.

            </div>
            <p>Fire and rescue service facilities may need to be provided in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> to assist
                                       with any evacuation of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> occupants, effect rescues of any casualties and to
                                       fight fires. The time taken for fire and rescue service intervention is
                                       dependent on a number of variables. The time to contact the emergency
                                       services, the location of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> in relation to the fire station
                                       and the height of the floor of fire origin above or below the fire and
                                       rescue service access level.
            </p>
            <p>Fires in tall <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> or in <a class="link" href="apa.html#basement_storey">basement storeys</a> may present additional
                                       risks to fire and rescue service personnel. Fire and smoke can suddenly
                                       change direction and intensity due to a number of factors which might induce
                                       reverse air flows. For example, the wind direction and velocity (which
                                       increases with height) could have a significant impact when fire-fighters
                                       open the door to the room or storey of fire origin. Similarly, limited
                                       ventilation available in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#basement_storey">basement storey</a> can lead to heat and
                                       smoke build up that is released through the opening the fire-fighters are
                                       using as an entry point.
            </p>
            <p>It is important that the facilities to assist the fire and rescue services
                                       take account of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design. The Building Disaster Assessment Group carried
                                       out extensive research on behalf of the UK Government to assess the
                                       interaction between <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design and the operational response of fire and rescue

                                       should complement fire-fighting and rescue capability. The 7.5m storey
                                       height above the ground is historically linked to the height at which fire
                                       and rescue service personnel can rescue occupants using the standard 13.5m
                                       portable ladder. Whilst this practice is no longer common, for health and
                                       safety reasons, fire-fighters continue to carry out external rescues as a
                                       last resort and <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design should recognise this.
            </p>
            <p>The 18m storey height above the ground is also historically linked with
                                       the reach capability of fire and rescue service equipment such as wheeled
                                       escape ladders (now obsolete). The general intent is that <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> with a
                                       storey at a height of more than 18m above the access level, cannot be easily
                                       reached by fire and rescue service equipment and personnel. Therefore, at
                                       least 1 fire-fighting shaft (fire-fighting stair, fire-fighting lobby, fire
                                       mains and in some cases a fire-fighting lift) is provided within the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> to allow
                                       equipment and personnel to be deployed as quickly as possible.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, fire-fighters cannot apply water jets from fire hoses onto
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#external_wall">external
                                              walls</a> high above the ground because of the limited reach
                                       capability. The guidance throughout this handbook including Standard 2.7,
                                       spread on external walls, recognises this limitation.
            </p>
            <p>The fire and rescue service facilities recommended in the table should be
                                       applied on every storey, however the lowest <a class="link" href="apa.html#basement_storey">basement storey</a> sets the level of

            <p>The fire and rescue service should be provided with the facility to
                                       release smoke and heat from a fire during their fire-fighting and rescue
                                       operations. Ventilation should be provided to every escape stair,
                                       fire-fighting stair and fire-fighting lobby unless excluded by the table to
                                       clause 2.14.2. The efficiency of the ventilators depends upon the prevailing
                                       wind and it is important that fire-fighters can control the opening and
                                       closing of the ventilators on arrival at the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Ventilators should be fitted with a simple handle or lock that can be
                                       operated by fire-fighters. If ventilators are not easily accessible they
                                       should be operated by a mechanism positioned within the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> at the fire
                                       and rescue service access point. In the case of an escape stair and
                                       fire-fighting stair, a local control should also be provided at the topmost
                                       storey. This will allow fire-fighters flexibility in their
                                       operations.

                                       Therefore, in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> where the topmost storey is more than 7.5m, a fire main
                                       should be installed in the fire-fighting lobby to help reduce fire attack
                                       time. Fire mains are also necessary to help fire-fighters to attack large

            <p>In some cases, (see table to clause 2.14.2) fire mains may be located in
