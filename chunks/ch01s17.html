                                       implements the terms of Articles 15 &amp; 16 of Directive 2010/31/EU on the

                                       system to Standard 6.7.
            </p>
            <p>For existing systems over 12kW, one way of meeting paragraph 1(a) of this
                                       regulation would be to make arrangements for an inspection to be carried out
                                       by an accredited expert. 
            </p>
            <p>In all cases, the accredited expert doing the inspection has the
                                       discretion to set the frequency of inspections ranging from three years for
                                       poorly maintained and inefficient systems up to five years for those systems
                                       that are well maintained and demonstrate excellent levels of efficiency. In
                                       order to ensure compliance with the continuing requirement, the subsequent
                                       inspection should be carried out within the intervening time period.
            </p>
            <p>The following issues should be considered in setting an inspection of
                                       systems more frequently than five years:
