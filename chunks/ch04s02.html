            <p>Land contamination is an unwanted legacy of Britain&#8217;s long industrial
                                       history. Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (inserted by
                                       Section 57 of the Environment Act 1995) was introduced to enable the
                                       identification and remediation of contaminated land from which contamination
                                       currently represents an unacceptable risk. Risks associated with the lands
                                       future use will continue to be dealt with under the planning and building
                                       standards system. Some functions of Part IIA, planning and building
                                       standards regimes may, at times, overlap.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Public registers</strong></span> - Part IIA adopts a
                                       &#8216;suitable for use approach&#8217; that requires the current risks to be assessed
                                       and remediated as required, for a sites existing use. The primary regulatory
                                       role for this rests with the local authorities. Local authorities and SEPA
                                       must establish public registers to record all prescribed regulatory action
                                       taken under Part IIA. The register will contain particulars relating to the
                                       remediation, as well as notifications of the identification of contaminated
                                       land. The registers will expand as new information is identified.
            </p>
            <p>Section 78A(2) of the Act (as amended) provides a specific definition of
                                       &#8216;contaminated land&#8217; for the purpose of the Act. Land that is not
                                       &#8216;contaminated land&#8217; as defined under the Act may still contain harmful or
                                       dangerous substances and the following guidance should be useful to the
                                       local authority in carrying out its other functions.

                                       of being contaminated is a material consideration when local authorities
                                       determine planning applications. The key role of the planning system is to
                                       ensure that all the ground included within the planning application is
                                       suitable for the proposed future use. Conditions may be added to any
                                       permission given to ensure the required remediation takes place. Planning

                                       role of planning and includes useful cross-references to other relevant

                                       &#8216;ground immediately adjoining&#8217; is intended to cover ground that is disturbed

            <p>The solum (prepared area within the containing walls of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>) should be
                                       treated to prevent vegetable growth and reduce the evaporation of moisture
                                       from the ground to the inner surface of any part of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> that it
                                       could damage.
            </p>
            <p>The solum should be brought to an even surface and any upfilling should be
                                       of hard, inert material. See guidance to Standard 3.4 relating to <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> elements

            <p>To prevent water collecting under the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>, the solum should be not lower
                                       than the highest level of the adjoining ground. However where this may not
                                       be possible, such as on sloping ground, the solum should be laid to fall to
                                       an outlet in the underbuilding above the lowest level of the adjoining
                                       ground to prevent any water build up below the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. Any part of the underbuilding
                                       that is in contact with the ground, such as on sloping ground, should be
                                       tanked (see clause 3.4.7).

            <p>During a walk-over of the area there may be signs of possible
                                       contaminants. The preliminary investigation can assist in the design of the
                                       exploratory and detailed ground investigation. A detailed ground
                                       investigation may be necessary and should provide sufficient information for
                                       the risk assessment and the design and specification of any remedial <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Risk assessment should be specific to each <a class="link" href="apa.html#building_site">building site</a> and take into account the
                                       presence of source, pathways and receptors at a particular <a class="link" href="apa.html#building_site">building site</a>.
                                       Generic assessment criteria may provide an indication of where further
                                       consideration of risk to receptors is required. The selection of assessment
                                       criteria should take into account the specific circumstances of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#building_site">building site</a> and
                                       the receptors that may be exposed. Assessment criteria should be
                                       authoritative and scientifically based. Should a risk be indicated then
                                       further consideration would be warranted. This may involve collection and
                                       assessment of further information. Useful tools for undertaking detailed
                                       assessment of risk are available e.g. CONSIM and CLEA. Reference should be

            <p>The Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA)
                                       produces many useful guidance documents on the application of different risk
                                       management techniques.
            </p>
            <p>There are a range of options for managing the risk of contamination. This
                                       can include removal or treatment of the contaminant source or breaking the
                                       pathway by which contaminants can present a risk to receptors:
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Removal</strong></span> means that the contaminant itself
                                       and any contaminated ground to be covered by the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> should be taken out to a depth
                                       of 1m (or less if the verifier agrees) below the level of the lowest floor.
                                       The contaminant should then be taken away to a place to be named by the
                                       local authority 
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Filling</strong></span> means that the ground to be
                                       covered by the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> should be covered to a depth of 1m (or less if the
                                       verifier agrees) with a material which will not react adversely with any
                                       contaminant remaining and may be used for making up levels. The type of
                                       filling and the design of the ground floor should be considered
                                       together
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Inert filling</strong></span> means that the filling is
                                       wholly non-combustible and not easily changed by chemical reactions
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Sealing</strong></span> means that a imperforate barrier
                                       is laid between the contaminant and the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and sealed at the joints, around
                                       the edges and at the service entries. Note that polyethylene may not be
                                       suitable if the contaminant is a liquid such as a tarry waste or organic
                                       solvent
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Ground treatment</strong></span> may provide a more cost
                                       effective and environmentally sustainable solution. Treatment may be the
                                       only option where the presence of structures or services prevents
                                       excavation. Treatment processes can be biological, chemical or physical and
                                       be undertaken either in-situ (contaminants are treated in the ground) or
                                       ex-situ (contaminated material is excavated and then treated before being
                                       returned). The processes convert the contaminant into a neutral form or
                                       render it harmless. There are also solidification and stabilisation
                                       processes that can &#8216;fix&#8217; contaminants in the soil so as to reduce the harm,
                                       and thermal processes that alter the contaminant by incineration or by
                                       volatilisation. The exact process to use will depend on the contaminant
                                       present and the soil type. Expert advice should be sought.
