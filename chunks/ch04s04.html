            <p>Serious river and coastal flooding that has occurred in a number of areas
                                       in Scotland is, unfortunately, not entirely preventable. Flooding can be
                                       diverse, often <a class="link" href="apa.html#site">site</a>
                                       specific and brought about by a range of factors including heavy rain,
                                       raised groundwater levels, increased rain water run-off and blocked or
                                       surcharged drainage systems. It is also generally recognised that climate
                                       change may play a major role in increasing the risk of flooding in the
                                       future, for example, local pluvial (rainfall) flooding from more frequent
                                       short intense rain storms.
            </p>
            <p>The effects of flooding on a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> can include significant damage
                                       to materials, services and structure. Contamination could result where waste
                                       water drainage is present in the floodwater. Where there is a risk that
                                       flooding can affect a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> it is important that any proposed <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> is
                                       designed to be more resistant or resilient.
            </p>
            <p>Pressure for land development may mean that development may be given
                                       planning approval on land subject to some risk of flooding. Where
                                       development is to take place on land assessed by the planning authority as
                                       having a flood risk, advice should be sought from sources such as the local
                                       planning authority, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and
                                       those responsible for coastal defences. Further guidance may be obtained
                                       from the &#8216;Scottish Planning Policy (SPP)&#8217;.
            </p>
            <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) provides flood risk
                                       information on their indicative river and coastal interactive flood maps on
                                       their website <a class="link" href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/" target="_top">http://www.sepa.org.uk/</a>.

                                       there is the potential for <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> activity to affect it or for the groundwater to
                                       pose a hazard to any new <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>. To reduce the risk to <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> from groundwater, subsoil
                                       drainage of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#site">site</a> may
                                       be necessary to protect against penetration of groundwater through a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and damage
