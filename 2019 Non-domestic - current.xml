                    <para>This is one of two Technical Handbooks, one covering <link

                            xreflabel="definedTerm">domestic buildings</link>. These Technical
                        Handbooks have been issued by Scottish Ministers for the purpose of
                        providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of the
                        provisions of the building regulations under a notice given in accordance
                        with Section 4(2) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. Each Handbook has
                        eight sections. Section 0, this section, is identical in both Handbooks. It
                        covers general issues and sets out how and when the regulations apply to
                            <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> and
                            <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link>.</para>
                    <para>The 2013 Edition of the Handbooks are being published electronically and
                        are available free on the Scottish Government, Building Standards Division
                        website. </para>
                    <para>Sections 1 to 7 give guidance on how to achieve the standards set by the
                        regulations, and there are different sets for <link
                            linkend="domestic_building" xreflabel="definedTerm">domestic
                            buildings</link> and non-<link linkend="domestic_building"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">domestic buildings</link>. The seven sections
                        each cover a number of related standards. They are:</para>
                    <para>Section 1 Structure</para>
                    <para>Section 2 Fire</para>
                    <para>Section 3 Environment</para>
                    <para>Section 4 Safety</para>
                    <para>Section 5 Noise</para>
                    <para>Section 6 Energy</para>
                    <para>Section 7 Sustainability</para>
                    <para>Each of the seven sections consists of an introduction and then general
                        guidance on the standards within the section. This is followed by each
                        standard which has specific introductory information and guidance on how to
                        comply with the standard. At the end of the Handbook, after Section 7, there
                        are the following two sections:</para>
                    <para>Appendix A: Defined terms.</para>
                    <para>Appendix B: List of standards and other publications.</para>
                    <para>The Technical Handbooks are supported by a Procedural Handbook, published
                        separately, which clarifies the intent of the Building (Scotland) Procedures
                        Regulations 2004. A separate procedural guidance document for Crown <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> has also
                        been produced.</para>

                    <title>0.1.2 The Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004</title>
                    <para>This Technical Handbook gives guidance on achieving the standards set in
                        the Building (Scotland) Regulations. The standards themselves can be found
                        in schedule 5 to regulation 9, and are in the form of ‘expanded functional
                        standards’. That is, the standards describe the functions a <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> should
                        perform, such as ‘providing resistance to the spread of fire’.</para>
                    <para>The Building (Scotland) Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers are
                        subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament. The content of the
                        regulations, so far as it relates to technical specifications, is also
                        scrutinised by the European Commission (EC). The EC checks with all the
                        other countries that have adopted the <link
                            linkend="construction_products_directive" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >Construction Products Regulations</link> (CPR) to ensure that no
                        barriers to trade in <link linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >construction</link> products are created, either directly or indirectly
                        by the way products are described.</para>
                    <para>To meet the requirements of the CPR, materials and <link
                            linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm">construction</link> methods
                        must be described by use of suitable European Standards wherever these
                        exist. As there is a rolling programme of change to these National and
                        European Standards, which includes conversion to, and the further provision
                        of, ENs and harmonised ENs, the Handbooks have been designed to be readily
                        updated. An explanation of the relevance and status of specific European and
                        British standards referred to in the Handbooks is in the section concerned.
                        There is also a list of the publications referred to in the Handbooks
                        provided in Appendix B.</para>
                    <para>The arrangement of Sections 1 - 7 within the Handbooks relates directly to
                        the Basic Works Requirements of the CPR (as published by the EC), which
                            <link linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm">construction</link>
                        <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link> are expected to
                        satisfy when they have been properly designed and <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">built</link>.  The arrangement is as
                        follows:</para>

                    <title>0.1.3 The building standards system</title>
                    <para>The building regulations are enforced through the building standards
                        system that is established by the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The Act sets
                        out the enabling powers that allow the Scottish Ministers to make, not only
                        the building regulations, but also procedural regulations, fees regulations
                        and the other supporting legislation needed to operate the system. The
                        system is designed to ensure that new <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> and <link linkend="work"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link> achieve the objectives of <link
                            linkend="the_act" xreflabel="definedTerm">the Act</link> in terms of
                        health, safety, welfare, convenience, conservation of fuel and power, and
                        sustainable development.</para>
                    <para>The roles of those operating the building standards system are explained
                        in detail in the guidance on the procedural regulations. Briefly, the duty
                        to comply with the building regulations lies with the owner, or in some
                        cases the client, for the <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >work</link>. Before <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >work</link> begins a building warrant must be obtained.</para>
                    <para>For some simpler <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link>
                        a warrant is not required (see regulation 5 and schedule 3), but the
                        regulations still apply. The owner or client again has the duty to comply.
                        The role of issuing warrants and accepting completion certificates rests
                        with verifiers, enforcement is by local authorities, and the system is
                        overseen and updated by the Building Standards Division (BSD).  BSD forms
                        part of the Scottish Government and acts on behalf of, and is responsible
                        to, Scottish Ministers. These bodies are further explained in the guidance
                        to the procedural regulations.</para>
                    <para>The building standards system is pre-emptive, ensuring so far as possible
                        that the proposed <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link>
                        will comply with the regulations. It recognises that proposals can change
                        during <link linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                        >construction</link>, so there are requirements for amendments to the
                        proposals to be agreed and recorded. On completion, the owner or client must
                        certify that the <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link>
                        have been <link linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >constructed</link> in accordance with the building warrant and the
                        building regulations. The verifier will make reasonable inquiry to ensure
                        the completion certificate is accurate before accepting the certificate.
                        Usually an inspection of the <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >works</link> will be made, and on most projects some inspection of
                            <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> in progress
                        will also have been carried out. However verifiers cannot inspect all
                        materials and <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> on
                        every <link linkend="building_site" xreflabel="definedTerm">building
                            site</link>. It is the client that should put in place the contractual
                        and practical arrangements needed to assure themselves that the desired
                        quality of <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> has been
                        achieved.</para>

                    <title>0.1.4 Status of Technical Handbooks</title>
                    <para>The regulations are mandatory, but the choice of how to comply lies with
                        the <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> owner.
                        This Technical Handbook has been issued by Scottish Ministers, through the
                        Building Standards Division, for the purpose of providing practical guidance
                        with respect to the building regulations. If the guidance is followed in
                        full then this should be accepted by the verifier as indicating that the
                        building regulations have been complied with. However it is quite acceptable
                        to use alternative methods of compliance provided they fully satisfy the
                        regulations.</para>
                    <para>Failure to comply with the Technical Handbook does not render a person
                        liable to civil or criminal procedures, but proof of compliance with the
                        guidance may be relied on in any proceedings as tending to negative
                        liability for an alleged contravention of the building regulations.</para>
                    <para>Following the advice in the Technical Handbooks is therefore likely to be
                        the normal way of complying with the building regulations. However, a
                        designer may put forward other ways of meeting the regulations, in the form
                        of alternative solutions.</para>
                    <para>There are a further three guidance documents that have the same standing
                        as the Technical Handbooks. Scottish Ministers have issued these under
                        Section 4(1) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. They are:</para>

                        provide alternative methods of showing compliance with those provided in the

                    <title>0.1.5 Alternative solutions</title>
                    <para>The use of expanded functional standards, backed up by detailed guidance,
                        provides a flexible system of control. Consideration of alternative
                        solutions is assisted by the expansion of the functional standards
                        previously used in the building standards regulations to clarify the
                        necessary properties of each <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link>. The need for a formal
                        relaxation of standards is reduced as meeting the full details of given
                        solutions is no longer mandatory. The professional judgement of the
                        verifier, assisted by guidance on questions referred to Scottish Ministers,
                        through the Building Standards Division, decides whether a standard is
                        met.</para>
                    <para>In considering alternative solutions, however it is necessary to have
                        regard to the details of this guidance. Where performance standards or
                        policy statements are given, every part of the solution is expected to meet
                        them. As a result, alternative solutions that appear suitable may not be
                        acceptable in detail. For example, some of the solutions offered in relation
                        to the English and Welsh building regulations, in the ‘Approved Documents’
                        (ADs), are not suitable because the levels of thermal insulation recommended
                        are not the same. Similarly different approaches are taken to the control of
                        fire size and the design of <link linkend="compartment"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">compartmentation</link> which means that <link
                            linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm">constructions</link> meeting
                        the AD on fire safety may not be acceptable. This will vary in time as both
                        ADs and the Scottish Technical Handbooks are updated. Solutions based on
                        other documents, such as British or European Standards, will have to be
                        carefully evaluated to see if the Scottish standards are being met in an
                        appropriate manner.</para>

                        appropriate parts from each Technical Handbook will need to be used to
                        ensure the standards are complied with in full, for example a caretakers
                            <link linkend="flat" xreflabel="definedTerm">flat</link> in an <link
                            linkend="office" xreflabel="definedTerm">office</link>
                        <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link>. However,
                        communal <link linkend="room" xreflabel="definedTerm">rooms</link> or other
                        areas in a block of <link linkend="dwelling" xreflabel="definedTerm"

                        considered using the domestic guidance. Examples of this might be a <link
                            linkend="room" xreflabel="definedTerm">room</link> used as an <link
                            linkend="office" xreflabel="definedTerm">office</link> for the operation

                        also a general principle that where a <link linkend="buildings"

                        It is not expected that the standards will change regularly as these are set
                        in the building regulations and can only be changed with Parliamentary
                        approval. Therefore it is anticipated that the guidance will be replaced
                        more regularly than the standards themselves.</para>

                    <para>Section 0 is arranged to follow the actual regulations. This sub-section
                        provides an introduction to the building standards system. Sub-section 0.2
                        covers regulations 1 and 2 which are the citation, commencement and
                        interpretation. Sub-sections 0.3 to 0.15 cover the significant technical
                        regulations with each sub-section setting out and discussing the regulation
                        with the same number (sub-section 0.3 covering regulation 3 etc.).
                        Regulation 16 establishes which regulations cannot ever be relaxed by
                        Scottish Ministers. These are the regulations on citation and commencement,
                        interpretation, exempted buildings, <link linkend="work"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> not requiring a warrant and the
                        methods of measurement. Regulation 17 was introduced in 2007 to help with
                        the implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.</para>

                    <para>Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act
                        2003, approve schemes for the certification of design or <link

                        compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are
                        approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take
                        account of the need to co-ordinate the <link linkend="work"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> of various designers and specialist
                        contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under
                        the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills
                        and experience required to certify compliance for the <link linkend="work"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> covered by the scope of the scheme.

                        <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> should be

                        guides the verifier as to where discretion is expected to be necessary. It
                        identifies those standards where it is not expected to be <link

                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> is expected where it is <link

                        bearing a CE mark (European Mark of Conformity) must be accepted as meeting
                        regulation requirements where the declaration of performance satisfies the
                        requirement and the product is being correctly used. </para>
                    <para>Sections 1 - 7 of the Technical Handbooks are arranged to equate with the
                        7 basic works requirements of the CPR. This should aid assessment of
                        products against the regulation requirements. There may however be other
                        Directives applicable to certain products or <link linkend="construct"

                    <para>A verifier may only reject CE marked products if the declaration of
                        performance does not meet the regulation requirement or the products are
                        being incorrectly used. If the verifier rejects a product the relevant
                        trading standards officer should be notified. This is a requirement of the
                        CPR, and will enable the UK government, where necessary, to notify the
                        European Commission.</para>
                    <para>It should be noted that CE marking alone does not show compliance with the
                        building regulations, as the CE mark may be showing compliance with other
                        Directives or Regulations applicable to certain products or constructions.

                        grandstand should include an engineer who has the necessary knowledge and

                    <para>Where alternative approaches to the structural design are proposed other
                        than using the guidance contained in this section, the structural design
                        should take account of all of the factors identified in clause 1.0.2 above.
                        For example, care should be taken where alternative numerical values are
                        placed on factors of safety as this may have a detrimental effect on the
                        overall stability of the structure.</para>
                    <para>The British Standards Institution (BSI) agreement with the European
                        Committee for Standardisation (CEN) obliges it to withdraw UK national
                        standards after a harmonised European Standard with the same scope and field
                        of application has been produced. Withdrawal of a standard implies that
                        while documents will still be available there will be no support or
                        five-year review by a BSI committee to consider the currency of the standard
                        and to decide whether it should be confirmed, revised or withdrawn. BSI, in
                        line with this commitment, will be 31 March 2010 replace the British
                        Standards relating to loading and structural design with the European
                        Standards and associated National Annexes listed in Sections 1.1.2 and 1.1.3
                        of this guidance.</para>
                    <para>Whilst other guidance documents or international standards, including
                        withdrawn national standards might be used in alternative approaches to
                        satisfy building regulations, designers, verifiers, or in the case of
                        certified projects, the approved certifiers of design (<link

                        for a specific project. Care should be exercised, particularly with
                        withdrawn standards, in relation to wind and snow loadings (actions) where
                        the effects of climate change may render these unsafe.</para>
                    <para>Where alternative approaches use design methods or codes other than those
                        listed in this guidance then these must be used within the context of the
                        assumptions set out in Section 1.1.3. Designs must be checked in order to
                        deliver similar levels of design reliability.</para>

                    <para>Temporary demountable structures are usually made from lightweight
                        components and are used for a wide variety of functions at public and
                        private events. They include grandstands, tents and marquees that can
                        accommodate large numbers of people, and stages and supports for performers.
                        A collapse of such a structure can have serious consequences. These
                        structures are usually in place for a short time, generally no more than 28
                        days, and may not be covered by the requirements of regulations 8 to 12. The
                        erection and use of many types of temporary structure will be controlled by
                        the local authority.</para>

                        partial safety factors for materials and loadings, and design methodology to

                        deal with fire safely and effectively.</para>

                        far greater. This is due to large occupancy capacities, building complexity,
                        occupant capability and behaviour including the potential for delay in
                        occupant evacuation following the outbreak of fire.</para>
                    <para>In the event of an outbreak of fire, it is important that the occupants
                        are warned as soon as possible. The guidance to Standard 2.11 provides
                        recommendations for the installation of alarm and detection systems in <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> where
                        people may be asleep or where there is a particularly high risk.</para>
                    <para>The standards and guidance in this section are designed to work together
                        to provide a balanced approach to fire safety. The <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> elements, materials, components
                        or other parts of the <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"

                        appropriate performance levels that are recommended throughout the guidance.
                        However where an element, material, component, or other part of a <link

                        height should be measured from the fire and rescue service access level and

                        the mandatory building standards 2.1 to 2.15. In the majority of projects it
                        is envisaged that meeting the guidance will be the usual means of showing
                        that compliance with the building standards has been achieved. </para>
                    <para>However, it should be appreciated that, due to the generic nature of the
                        guidance it cannot cover all building designs or, for example, innovative or
                        new methods of construction. In such cases the designer or engineer will be
                        required to show, by alternative means, that compliance with the building
                        standards will be achieved in the completed <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link>. For example, where the elements
                        of structure are engineered timber (including cross laminated timber), the
                        structure should maintain stability during the fire growth and fully
                        developed post flashover phases of the fire without reliance on intervention
                        from the fire and rescue services. Encapsulation of combustible elements of
                        structure may require to be provided to protect the structure against
                        ignition and charring for the duration of the fire. Where encapsulation
                        (i.e. both physically and in terms of the period of fire resistance
                        duration) is not provided or does not protect the combustible material
                        against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire, the structural
                        fire engineer should consider the additional contribution of the exposed
                        combustible material to the fire load density including an assessment of the
                        structural stability of the <link linkend="buildings"

                        standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be consulted early
                        in the design process.</para>
                    
                        <para>Fire safety engineering may be the only practical way to achieve a

                        innovative or new methods of construction are used. In such cases a holistic
                        approach is desirable from first principles rather than following, in part
                        or wholly, the guidance contained in the Technical Handbooks. In such cases
                        the building standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be
                        consulted as part of the Qualitative Design Review (QDR) process.</para>
                    <para>For many projects it is likely that designers will follow the guidance in
                        the Technical Handbooks and fire engineering techniques will not be
                        necessary. In its simplest form the QDR team may define the acceptance
                        criteria in terms of compliance with the Handbooks.</para>
                    <para>However, it is common for fire engineers and regulators to be engaged
                        relatively late in the design process to resolve fire safety issues raised
                        during the verification or, in extreme cases, the construction process. This
                        is unhelpful as fire engineers are often commissioned to resolve specific
                        issues where the design does not follow the guidance rather than assessing
                        the building holistically. This can lead to a comparative exercise against
                        unrealistic worse case scenarios of a “code compliant” design to justify
                        deviations. This is not the intent of the guidance and it is important that
                        the safety goals are well defined and achieved with a sufficient margin of
                        safety. The objective of a comparative study should be to demonstrate that
                        the building design, as a whole, presents no greater risk to the occupants
                        than a similar type of building designed in accordance with the Technical
                        Handbook guidance. Further, it is common for the inappropriate use of
                        Computational Fluid Dynamics where the deviations from the Handbooks would
                        not merit such an exercise to be carried out. It is recognised that there
                        may be instances where small deviations from the guidance do not warrant a
                        “whole building” fire engineered design and inevitably involves a degree of
                        negotiation without the need for detailed analysis.</para>
                    
                        <para>Not all cases of variance from the guidance will require the

                        and/or statistical information to demonstrate an adequate level of safety
                        for a specific <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link>, structure or installation. In this regard the fire
                        safety strategy is based on performance rather than prescription. Therefore,
                        fire safety engineering is about the need to identify the fire hazard,
                        assess the fire risks, understand the consequences and to offer fire safety
                        strategies and designs to show how the objectives have been met. The ‘tools’
                        that support fire engineering can include calculation methods, which are
                        used to demonstrate that under a worst reasonable case, tenable conditions
                        are maintained during the evacuation period. For example, a smoke exhaust
                        fan in a smoke reservoir within an atrium space fails to operate but the
                        smoke layer height continues to be maintained by the activation of a
                        stand-by fan.</para>
                    <para>It is recognised that fire engineering is still a rapidly developing field
                        and as such does not have the standardised codes for approaching and solving
                        problems compared to other engineering disciplines. The documents identified
                        above aim to provide a structured framework for assessing the interaction
                        between, <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link>,
                        people and fire, and to facilitate innovation in design without compromising
                        safety. They provide information on how to undertake a detailed analysis of
                        specific aspects of fire safety engineering in <link linkend="buildings"

                    <para>In practice, both frameworks provide a flexible but formalised engineering
                        approach to fire safety which can be applied to new or existing <link

                        decisions taken during the preparation of the fire engineering brief as

                        is too high above the ground to be within the reach capability of

                        particularly challenging when the cavity is ventilated and the surfaces
                        exposed in the cavity promote rapid fire spread.</para>

                    <para>Wall and ceiling surfaces mean the substrate or lining material including
                        any treatment thereof to restrict flame spread, but excludes any decorative
                        wallpaper or paints. Whilst it is accepted that such wallpaper or paints are
                        not controlled by the guidance, multiple layers applied to the face of a
                        wall or ceiling surface can increase flame spread and hence the fire growth
                        rate. For this reason, multiple layers are not recommended when carrying out
                        refurbishment work involving the re-decoration of wall and ceiling
                        surfaces.</para>

                        provide a significant hazard in a fire. Burning droplets can rapidly
                        increase the fire growth rate and the smoke produced is normally dense and
                        toxic which combine to produce extremely hazardous conditions. For these
                        reasons, thermoplastic material should not be used in <link

                        because the mobility, awareness and understanding of the occupants could be
                        impaired and as a consequence, full evacuation immediately a fire is
                        discovered may not be the most appropriate course of action.</para>
                    <para>Fire-fighters may not be able to apply a water jet from a fire-fighting
                        hose directly onto a fire that has spread onto or within an external wall
                        high above the ground. This is because the external wall is either
                        inaccessible or is out with the reach capability of fire-fighting equipment.
                        Therefore, the construction of external walls in taller buildings should not
                        contribute to the development of fire or contribute to vertical fire spread
                        up the facade of the building. The 11m storey height in clause 2.7.1 and
                        clause 2.7.2 is based on the reach capability of a fire and rescue service
                        ground mounted water jet where there is sufficient pressure and flow in the
                        water main. Designers are encouraged to seek early advice from the fire and
                        rescue service if they wish to vary from the guidance where, for example,
                        the façade is accessible to high reach appliances. Also, see annex 2.B for
                        exceptions.</para>

                        risk from fires starting beyond their boundaries. The area of greatest
                        vulnerability is the roof and there may be a risk of ignition or penetration
                        by burning brands, flames or heat. The degree of protection for roof
                        coverings is dependent upon the distance to the <link linkend="boundary"

                        <para>A roof covering consists of one or more layers of material such as

                        whole of the roof structure. Solar roof panels should be regarded as forming
                        part of the roof covering and as such should be able to resist ignition from
                        an external source. Most solar panels are <link linkend="glazing"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">glazed</link> and their ability to inhibit fire
                        spread can be determined by the thickness of <link linkend="glazing"

                    <para>Travel distance is the term applied to the distance that occupants have to

                            door</link> and is measured along the actual route of escape from any
                        point within a storey, including the distance across <link linkend="room"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">rooms</link>.</para>
                    <para>The further occupants need to travel within a <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> to reach a <link

                        the greater the risk from the effects of fire. The travel distance should
                        allow for the occupants to reach a <link linkend="protected_door"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">protected door</link> before being overcome by
                        fire or smoke. This distance will depend on the nature of the fire and the

                    <para>Occupants should be able to reach a <link linkend="protected_door"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">protected door</link> before there is a

                    <para>Therefore, to provide for safe evacuation of the occupants, it is
                        necessary to have limitations on the distance occupants should have to
                        travel to reach a <link linkend="protected_door" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >protected door</link>.</para>
                    <para>The limitations on travel distances reflect the different levels of
                        protection that are necessary for the <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> occupants, based on the fire
                        hazard and occupancy profile. The distances and available directions of
                        travel, given in the following table and the guidance on travel distance,

                        the principle of forcing air into the escape route which helps to keep smoke

                        could result in a proportion of fire or smoke and toxic fumes arising from a
                        fire flowing up through the opening leading to a build-up of smoke on the

                    <para>It is important that any outbreak of fire in premises is detected at an
                        early stage in order that the occupants once alerted can commence evacuation
                        of the premises as soon as possible. There should also be a means so that
                        anyone in the <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link> who discovers a fire, can alert others to the existence
                        of the fire and this should include arrangements for calling the fire and
                        rescue service. The benefit of early warning of a fire will increase the
                        probability of the safe evacuation of the <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> and will assist owners and

                    <para>Fire detection and fire alarm system is a term used in this handbook to
                        describe any type of automatic sensor network and associated control and
                        indicating equipment. Sensors may be sensitive to smoke, heat, gaseous
                        combustion products or radiation. Normally the control and indicating
                        equipment operates a fire alarm system and it may perform other signalling
                        or control functions as well. Automatic sprinkler systems may also be used
                        to operate a fire alarm system.</para>

                        vested in a public water authority or a supply provided under the Fire
                        (Scotland) Act 2005 as amended. Alternative arrangements, including private

                        involved using a combination of offensive and defensive tactics until the
                        fire is brought under control and extinguished.</para>

                        increases with height) could have a significant impact when fire-fighters
                        open the door to the room or storey of fire origin. Similarly, limited
                        ventilation available in a <link linkend="basement_storey"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">basement storey</link> can lead to heat and
                        smoke build up that is released through the opening the fire-fighters are

                        should complement fire-fighting and rescue capability. The 7.5m storey
                        height above the ground is historically linked to the height at which fire
                        and rescue service personnel can rescue occupants using the standard 13.5m
                        portable ladder. Whilst this practice is no longer common, for health and
                        safety reasons, fire-fighters continue to carry out external rescues as a
                        last resort and <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link> design should recognise this.</para>
                    <para>The 18m storey height above the ground is also historically linked with
                        the reach capability of fire and rescue service equipment such as wheeled
                        escape ladders (now obsolete). The general intent is that <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> with a
                        storey at a height of more than 18m above the access level, cannot be easily
                        reached by fire and rescue service equipment and personnel. Therefore, at
                        least 1 fire-fighting shaft (fire-fighting stair, fire-fighting lobby, fire
                        mains and in some cases a fire-fighting lift) is provided within the <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> to allow

                    <para>In addition, fire-fighters cannot apply water jets from fire hoses onto

                    <para>The fire and rescue service facilities recommended in the table should be

                        necessary to escape following the outbreak of fire. The primary role of the
                        suppression system may be for life safety or property protection.</para>

                        for example the fire growth is fast and the temperatures allow the sprinkler
                        system to open early in the development phase of the fire. The spray pattern
                        delivered from the heads should control fire spread, reduce temperatures and
                        dilute the smoke. In some cases, the fire might be extinguished if the fire
                        is not shielded from the sprinkler spray. A smaller fire means that the fire
                        and rescue service will be able to bring the fire under control and
                        extinguish it much more quickly.</para>

                        flow is likely to be. If there is any doubt, a tank and pump arrangement

                    <title>2.D.0 Introduction</title>
                    <para>This annex provides guidance on how to establish the resistance to fire of
                        a <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> element
                        or component. Whilst it could be argued that occupants of a <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> only need
                        minutes to reach relative safety such as a <link linkend="protected_zone"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">protected zone</link>, it should be remembered
                        that the fire tests used to establish fire resistance duration in terms of
                        time, do not replicate a real fire. In order to ensure the safe evacuation
                        of the <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link>
                        occupants and to ensure that fire-fighters are not placed at undue risk, it
                        is necessary to apply certain factors of safety to the fire resistance
                        duration for structural and non-structural fire protection. For example, in
                        a large intense fire, a British or European Standard 30 minute <link

                        Reference throughout this document to a short, medium or long fire
                        resistance duration, will be satisfied by following the guidance in the

                    <para>Any test evidence or assessment used to substantiate the fire resistance
                        rating of a wall, floor, ceiling, door or shutter should be carefully
                        checked to ensure that it demonstrates compliance with appropriate fire
                        tests and performance criteria contained in this handbook and is applicable
                        to the complete installed assembly. For example, in the case of floors or
                        ceilings small differences in details such as openings for lighting or
                        ventilation can significantly affect the rating. Similarly, fire doors may
                        also have small differences in detail such as glazing apertures, intumescent
                        strips, door frames and ironmongery etc which may significantly affect the
                        rating.</para>

                        Standard classifications are withdrawn.</para>

                    <para>For all construction products, the consideration is of a fire, initiated
                        in a room, which can grow and eventually reach flashover. This scenario
                        includes three fire situations corresponding to three stages in the
                        development of a fire:</para>

                                <para>the first stage includes initiation of the fire by ignition of
                                    a product, with a small flame, on a limited area of a
                                    product,</para>

                                <para>the second stage addresses fire growth eventually reaching
                                    flashover. It is simulated by a single burning item in a corner
                                    of the room, creating a heat flux on adjacent surfaces. For
                                    floorings, fire is seen to grow in the room of origin, creating
                                    a heat flux on the floorings in an adjacent room or corridor,
                                    through a door opening, and</para>

                    <para>Currently, there is no recognised European Harmonised fire test for
                        facades or construction products exposed to a fire in a cavity. It has
                        therefore been necessary to use the reaction to fire classification system
                        in BS EN 13501-1: 2018 for external wall cladding systems in certain
                        circumstances.</para>

                    <para>BS 476: Part 3: 2012 sets out a classification system based on external
                        penetration and flame spread as set out in the following table. The first
                        letter of the designation indicates fire penetration performance i.e. the
                        time at which any glowing or flaming [other than that from the gas pilot
                        flame] appears on the underside of the specimen. The second letter of the
                        designation indicates flame spread performance. The addition of the suffix
                        ‘X’ indicates dripping from the underside of the specimen, any mechanical
                        failure or development of holes in the specimen. The angle of the specimen
                        in the test is designated by the prefix ’S’ [slope] or ‘F’ [flat].</para>

                    <para>Water, air and soil are intricately linked and all can be affected by
                        various forms of pollution that affect our environment. Other issues such as
                        condensation have been a constant threat to people and <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> for many
                        years.</para>
                    <para>Industrial change and demographic shift during the 19th and 20th centuries
                        resulted in large-scale re-organisation of our villages, towns and cities.
                        Industries moved out or disappeared altogether leaving large, 'brownfield',
                        gaps in our landscape. At the same time, changes in heating methods and the
                        advent of the consumer society, have had a significant effect on the type
                        and volume of refuse it has been necessary to dispose of to landfill.
                        Inevitably, these changes have left behind a legacy of land contamination
                        that in some cases, may be harmful. The Scottish Government encourages the
                        use of previously developed land (brownfield) and local authorities may wish
                        to promote brownfield land in preference to greenfield land. Some of this
                        land will be contaminated and will need to be made safe.</para>
                    <para>Climate is controlled by the long-term balance of energy of the Earth and
                        its atmosphere. Natural events cause changes in climate but human activities
                        can also change the climate. The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the
                        atmosphere due to human activities will change the climate by enhancing the
                        natural greenhouse effect, leading to an increase in the Earth's average
                        surface temperature resulting in heavier rainfall.</para>
                    <para>Indoor air quality complaints are frequently associated with comfort
                        issues: high or low temperatures, draughts, high or low humidity or poor
                        lighting. However the incidence of real indoor pollution should not be
                        ignored, it is surprisingly common. The <link linkend="construct"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">construction</link> quality of <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> is
                        improving with a resulting reduction of adventitious air infiltration
                        producing fewer air changes. Inadequate ventilation, inefficient filtration
                        and poor hygiene all contribute to poor indoor air quality.</para>
                    <para>Carbon monoxide (CO) gas has no smell, taste or colour and it kills dozens
                        of people in their homes every year. Many more suffer debilitating illnesses
                        often without anybody realising that they are being poisoned. CO gas is
                        produced by combustion appliances such as fires, boilers and water heaters.
                        Any appliance that burns solid fuel, gas or oil and that does not have a
                        room-sealed balanced flue so that it is sealed off from the <link

                        poisoning you if it is not properly installed, maintained and serviced. The
                        highest incidence of CO poisoning occurs in <link

                    <para>Oil accounts for about a third of all reported pollution incidents in
                        Scotland that are investigated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency
                        (SEPA). That means around 500 to 600 pollution incidents a year with about
                        10 to 12% being serious. It is an offence to cause pollution and courts now
                        impose heavy fines. Although domestic pollution is low compared with
                        commercial and industrial <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >buildings</link>, it is important to ensure standards are not
                        lowered.</para>

                        considered to prevent environmental pollution and uncontrollable run-off
                        during periods of heavy rainfall leading to flooding. The incorporation of
                        water conservation measures in <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> can reduce pressure on precious
                        water resources by recycling water from certain types of appliance.
                        Recycling can also reduce the reliance on mains water and limit the amount
                        of water discharged thus alleviating the risk of flooding. The inclusion of
                        ‘green roofs’ into <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"

                        <para>Land contamination is an unwanted legacy of Britain’s long industrial
                        history. Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (inserted by
                        Section 57 of the Environment Act 1995) was introduced to enable the
                        identification and remediation of contaminated land from which contamination
                        currently represents an unacceptable risk. Risks associated with the lands
                        future use will continue to be dealt with under the planning and building
                        standards system. Some functions of Part IIA, planning and building
                        standards regimes may, at times, overlap.</para>

                        ‘suitable for use approach’ that requires the current risks to be assessed
                        and remediated as required, for a sites existing use. The primary regulatory
                        role for this rests with the local authorities. Local authorities and SEPA
                        must establish public registers to record all prescribed regulatory action
                        taken under Part IIA. The register will contain particulars relating to the
                        remediation, as well as notifications of the identification of contaminated
                        land. The registers will expand as new information is identified.</para>
                    
                    <para>Section 78A(2) of the Act (as amended) provides a specific definition of
                        ‘contaminated land’ for the purpose of the Act. Land that is not
                        ‘contaminated land’ as defined under the Act may still contain harmful or
                        dangerous substances and the following guidance should be useful to the
                        local authority in carrying out its other functions.</para>

                        of being contaminated is a material consideration when local authorities
                        determine planning applications. The key role of the planning system is to
                        ensure that all the ground included within the planning application is
                        suitable for the proposed future use. Conditions may be added to any

                        investigation may be necessary and should provide sufficient information for
                        the risk assessment and the design and specification of any remedial <link

                        criteria should take into account the specific circumstances of the <link

                        the receptors that may be exposed. Assessment criteria should be
                        authoritative and scientifically based. Should a risk be indicated then
                        further consideration would be warranted. This may involve collection and

                        excavation. Treatment processes can be biological, chemical or physical and
                        be undertaken either in-situ (contaminants are treated in the ground) or
                        ex-situ (contaminated material is excavated and then treated before being
                        returned). The processes convert the contaminant into a neutral form or
                        render it harmless. There are also solidification and stabilisation
                        processes that can ‘fix’ contaminants in the soil so as to reduce the harm,
                        and thermal processes that alter the contaminant by incineration or by
                        volatilisation. The exact process to use will depend on the contaminant
                        present and the soil type. Expert advice should be sought.</para>

                        - Occupational exposure to natural radiation sources, including radon gas,
                        is the subject of regulatory control. This is in line with the most recent
                        revision to the Euratomic Basic Safety Standards Directive (Council
                        Directive 96/29/EURATOM) that establishes a common basis for radiation
                        protection legislation in all European Member States. Regulation 3 of the
                        Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/3232) sets a national
                        reference level for radon gas in workplaces of 400
                            Bq/m<superscript>3</superscript> averaged over any 24 hour  period. An
                        employer or self-employed person responsible for a workplace is required to
                        measure radon levels in the workplace on being directed to do so.</para>
                    <para>If radon levels are found to be in excess of the reference level, the
                        regulations require that measures be taken to safeguard the health of

                        in Scotland is, unfortunately, not entirely preventable. Flooding can be

                        specific and brought about by a range of factors including heavy rain,

                        surcharged drainage systems. It is also generally recognised that climate
                        change may play a major role in increasing the risk of flooding in the
                        future, for example, local pluvial (rainfall) flooding from more frequent
                        short intense rain storms.</para>

                        junction fitting. Where the connection is to a public sewer, the Water

                        treatment system is an effective, economical way of treating <link

                        consists of 2 main components, a watertight underground tank into which raw
                        sewage is fed and a system designed to discharge the <link
                            linkend="wastewater" xreflabel="definedTerm">wastewater</link> safely to
                        the environment without pollution. This is normally an infiltration field
                        through which <link linkend="wastewater" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >wastewater</link> is released to the ground, but when ground conditions
                        are not suitable, a discharge to a watercourse or coastal waters may be
                        permitted. The infiltration field provides secondary treatment and is often
                        critical for protecting the environment from pollution. Not all treatment
                        plants treat to the same standard, for example, biological treatment plants
                        treat the <link linkend="wastewater" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >wastewater</link> to a much higher standard than septic tanks prior to
                        release of the <link linkend="wastewater" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >wastewater</link> thus reducing pollution and permitting a smaller
                        infiltration field. As there are many different types of treatment plants
                        with varying degrees of efficiency, then the type chosen should be selected
                        for the effluent standard required to protect the environment.</para>

                        <para>The intention of this standard is to ensure that non-mains drainage
                        systems are designed and constructed to a standard so that the discharges
                        from them do not contribute to environmental pollution and will achieve
                        statutory environmental standards. Subject to discharge authorisation from
                        SEPA, (see clause 3.8.5) wastewater from treatment systems can either
                        discharge to land via an infiltration system or to watercourses, lochs or
                        coastal waters. The guidance to this standard deals with discharges to land
                        via infiltration systems. The infiltration method will form a critical part
                        of the treatment system and care must be taken in the type, design and
                        location chosen to avoid environmental pollution. The guidance to this
                        standard should be used in conjunction with the guidance to Standard 3.8
                        when designing wastewater treatment systems.</para>
                    <para>Several hundreds of wastewater treatment systems are thought to cause
                        pollution problems every year. These problems occur mainly because of poor
                        location, poor drainage field design or lack of maintenance.</para>

                        hole will enable the sub-soil type to be determined. The trial hole should
                        be a minimum of 2m deep, or a minimum of 1.5m below the invert of the
                        proposed distribution pipes. The trial hole should be left covered for a
                        period of 48 hours before measuring any water table level. Subsoils that
                        overlay bedrock allow water to move through the pore spaces between the
                        grains of material of which they are composed. They are the first line of
                        defence against pollution and act as a protecting filtering layer. Where
                        these materials are unsaturated, pollution attenuation processes are often
                        enhanced. Water flows through much of Scotland’s bedrock via fissures.

                                    apart along the line of and below the proposed invert level of
                                    the effluent distribution pipe. Each hole should be 300mm square
                                    to a depth of 300mm. Where deep drains are necessary, the holes
                                    should conform to this shape at the bottom but may be enlarged
                                    above the 300mm level to facilitate safe excavation. Fill the
                                    300mm square section of the holes to a depth of at least 300mm
                                    with water and allow them to seep away overnight. It is
                                    important to saturate the soil surrounding the test holes to
                                    simulate day to day conditions in an operational drainage field.
                                    Next day, refill the test sections of the percolation holes with
                                    water to a depth of at least 300mm and observe the time (t) in
                                    seconds, for the water to seep away from 75% to 25% full level.
                                    Divide this time by 150mm. The answer gives the average time in
                                    seconds (Vp) required for the water to drop 1mm. Take care when
                                    making the tests to avoid unusual weather conditions such as
                                    heavy rain, severe frost or drought. To obtain consistent
                                    results carry out the test at least 3 times for each percolation
                                    hole and take the average figure.</para>

                    <para>It is important that <link linkend="sanitary_facility"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">sanitary facilities</link> address the needs of
                        occupants and visitors, both in terms of availability and accessibility.
                        Facilities should be sufficient in number to prevent queuing, other than in
                        exceptional circumstances. Variety in the range and type of facilities
                        provided, particularly in larger buildings, should minimise barriers to the
                        simple and convenient use of sanitary accommodation. </para>

                        <para>The human body absorbs lead easily from drinking water and this can
                        have a negative effect on the intellectual development of young children.
                        Although mains water supplies do not contain significant levels of lead,
                        recent research studies have shown that leaded solder plumbing fittings,
                        normally used for heating systems, have been used on drinking water pipework
                        in contravention of the Scottish Water Byelaws 2004. Further guidance can be

                    <para>The occurrence of condensation is governed by complex interrelationships

                        which receives very much more water from driving rain. However excess

                            xreflabel="definedTerm">construction</link>. Clause 8.4.1 of BS 5250
                        lists various issues that should be considered in the design of roofs to
                        reduce the possibility of excess condensation forming that might damage the
                            <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> and
                        endanger the health of the occupants. However cold, level-deck roofs, should
                        be avoided because interstitial condensation is likely and its effect on the
                        structure and insulation can be severe and many instances of failure in such
                        systems have been recorded. It is considered that more reliable forms of

                        broken by the penetration of an element allowing a significantly higher heat
                        loss than its surroundings. These ‘bridges’ commonly occur around openings
                        such as lintels, jambs and sills and at wall/roof junctions, wall/floor
                        junctions and where internal walls penetrate the outer fabric. Thermal
                        bridges provide a ready passage of heat transfer to the outside air and
                        allow a heat flow entirely disproportionate to their surface area resulting
                        in excessive heat losses. Condensation may occur on the inner surfaces that
                        can damage the <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"

                    <para>The pressure designation N2 is regarded as the most likely specification
                        to apply in the oil industry for both vaporising and pressure jet
                        appliances. Most pressure jet appliances only generate adequate pressure to
                        overcome flow resistance within the appliance so that the products of
                        combustion entering the <link linkend="chimney" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >chimney</link> will be at a negative pressure with respect to the
                        atmosphere. Thus the appliance can be safely used with <link
                            linkend="chimney" xreflabel="definedTerm">chimneys</link> and <link

                        negative pressure designation. In the event that an appliance design
                        produces a positive pressure at the outlet of the appliance, it is the
                        manufacturer’s responsibility to inform the installer that a <link

                        designation should be used. If there is any doubt, the more onerous
                        designation P2 should apply.</para>

                        In 2010-11 Fire fighters attended  1565 chimney fires  in Scotland. The main
                        cause of these fires was inadequate maintenance of the <link
                            linkend="chimney">chimneys</link>, including routine cleaning of <link
                            linkend="flue">flues</link>. </para>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Combustion appliances</emphasis> fuelled by solid
                        fuel, oil or gas all have the potential to cause carbon monoxide (CO)
                        poisoning if they are poorly installed or commissioned, inadequately
                        maintained or incorrectly used. Inadequate ventilation or a lack of the
                        correct maintenance of appliances, <link linkend="flue">flues</link> and
                            <link linkend="chimney">chimneys</link> are the main causes of CO
                        poisoning. Poisonous CO gas is produced when fuel does not burn properly.
                        Incidents of poisoning can also occur through deterioration of the structure
                        of the <link linkend="flue">flue</link> or <link linkend="chimney"
                            >chimney</link>. Every year in Scotland there are fatalities from CO
                        poisoning directly attributed to combustion appliances installed in <link
                            linkend="buildings">buildings</link>. In addition to these deaths there
                        are also a considerable number of incidents where people are treated in
                        hospital for the effects of CO poisoning. In some cases CO poisoning can
                        result in serious and permanent injury to persons affected. Where CO gas may
                        occur within a <link linkend="buildings">building</link> early detection and
                        warning can play a vital role in the protection and safety of the occupants.
                        This is particularly important in <link linkend="buildings">buildings</link>
                        with sleeping accommodation.</para>

                            >flues</link> can also have serious repercussions. If a <link
                            linkend="flue" xreflabel="definedTerm">flue</link> is too small, an
                        insufficient volume of air will pass through it and this may lead to
                        spillage of combustion gases. Too large a <link linkend="flue"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">flue</link> will slow down the flow of
                        combustion gases and this may also lead to spillage.</para>
                    <para>The use of fanned <link linkend="flue">flues</link> allows combustion
                        appliances to be located away from external walls. In such installations the
                            <link linkend="flue">flues</link> can often be concealed within ceiling
                        or wall voids making it difficult to determine whether the <link
                            linkend="flue">flue</link> is still in good condition when an appliance
                        is serviced or maintained.   </para>
                    <para>Damaged or poorly maintained flues can allow CO gases to escape from the

                    <title>3.23.0 Introduction</title>
                    <para>The guidance on oil relates only to its use solely where it serves a
                        combustion appliance providing space heating or cooking facilities in a
                            <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link>. There
                        is other legislation covering the storage of oils for other purposes.
                        Heating oils comprise Class C2 oil (kerosene) or Class D oil (gas oil) as
                        specified in BS 2869: 2006.</para>
                    <para>It is considered unlikely that a fire will originate from the stored oil.
                        It is the purpose of this guidance therefore, to ensure that a fire that may
                        originate from a <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link>, or other external source, is not transferred to the
                        tank contents, or if a fire does occur, its effects are limited.</para>
                   
                        <para>The acceptance of climate change and the environmental policies put in
                            place to mitigate its impact are pushing the commercial introduction of
                            renewable energy technologies to displace the use of fossil fuels and
                            the related combustion emissions of greenhouse gases. Woody biomass can
                            be used as an alternative to fossil fuels and in some EU countries
                            biomass fuel is the principal source of renewable energy for heating
                            applications. The carbon dioxide emitted when biomass is burnt can be
                            considered to be offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed as trees grow.
                            Whilst this does not compensate for the energy used in processing the
                            wood for fuel, the carbon dioxide emissions are considerably less than
                            those of fossil fuels.</para>
              
                        <para>The use of woody biomass, in the form of wood chips, wood pellets and
                        logs may offer a viable alternative to fossil fuels, particularly in areas
                        not served by the gas grid, although the supply and distribution of chips
                        and pellets is, as yet, poorly developed in Scotland.</para>

                    <para>Oil is a common and highly visible form of water pollution. Because of the
                        way it spreads, even a small quantity can cause a lot of harm to the aquatic
                        environment. Oil can pollute rivers, lochs, groundwater and coastal waters
                        killing wildlife and removing vital oxygen from the water. Large quantities
                        of water are taken from rivers and groundwater for use as drinking water and
                        for irrigation. Oil contamination can make water unfit for these
                        purposes.</para>
                    <para>Oil accounts for about a third of all reported pollution incidents in
                        Scotland that are investigated by SEPA each year. That means around 500 to
                        600 pollution incidents a year with about 10 to 12% being serious. It is an
                        offence to cause pollution and courts now impose heavy fines.</para>
                    
                        <para>Oil is a ‘List I’ substance within the meaning of the EC Groundwater
                        Directive (80/68/EEC). The UK government is required by this directive to
                        prevent List I substances from entering groundwater and to prevent
                        groundwater pollution by List II substances.</para>

                    <para>In order to best exploit the advantages achieved through the use of woody
                        biomass as low carbon technology it is recommended that wood fuel storage
                        provision is of a size that will ensure bulk deliveries need not be made at
                        intervals of less than 1 month.</para>
                    <para>Deliveries of wood pellets may be less frequent than deliveries of wood
                        chips because pellets can have 3 times the calorific value of dry wood
                        chips. Alternatively, the storage volume can be smaller for the same energy
                        capacity.</para>
                    <para>The following table provides recommendations for some <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> types of
                        varying size on the storage recommendations that will permit a large enough
                        volume to be delivered whilst minimising vehicle movements. The table is
                        intended to provide an estimate of fuel storage based on heat demand and to
                        help with initial studies. A more systematic exercise should be carried out
                        during development of the scheme design. Advice on the sizing of storage for
                        woody biomass fuel for smaller <link linkend="buildings"

                        incorporates basic precautions to guard against accident and falls.</para>

                        of difficulty. Design should also address the issue of appropriate guarding,
                        where a level change is made, and seek to eliminate any possible trip

                    <para>A choice in seating location for wheelchair users should be available.
                        Spaces should not be provided as a single area but dispersed through the
                        seated area, as single spaces or pairs. Spaces should be next to standard
                        seating to allow a spectator who uses a wheelchair to sit with family or
                        friends.</para>

                        building, a vehicle protective barrier should be provided to the edge of any
                        such area that is above the level of any adjoining floor, ground or any

                    <para>When designing barriers to resist vehicular impact, an estimate of the
                        characteristic mass of the vehicle should be made. Ideally, this should be
                        determined statistically. If this is not possible, the characteristic mass
                        should be taken to be equal to the maximum mass anticipated. Further
                        information on estimation of equivalent static forces for a given
                        characteristic mass and displacement can be obtained in Annex A to BS 6180:

                    <para>Noise is unwanted sound. In order to limit the effects of unwanted sound
                        the standards intend to improve the resistance of <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> elements to sound transmission.
                        Research has presented clear evidence that noise can indirectly contribute
                        to a range of health issues such as stress and anxiety.</para>
                    <para>Inadequate sound insulation can impair health by allowing noise from other
                        people to disrupt normal life. A number of people in <link
                            linkend="residential_building" xreflabel="definedTerm">residential
                            buildings</link> complain of noise made by others. The World Health
                        Organisation has established a relationship between noise exposure and sleep
                        disturbance however the next-day or long-term effects are still not
                        clear.</para>

                    <title>5.0.2 Aims</title>
                    <para>The purpose of the standards in Section 5 is to limit the transmission of
                        sound to a level that will not threaten the health of occupants from sound
                        transmission emanating from attached <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> and a differently occupied part
                        of the same <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link>. They also cover sound from within the same <link

                        are in <link linkend="room" xreflabel="definedTerm">rooms</link> where they
                        would expect to have some degree of peace and quiet.</para>
                    <para>It is important to recognise that the standards will not guarantee freedom
                        from unwanted sound transmission. The standards aim to limit the effects
                        from sound created from normal domestic activities, but not from excessive
                        noise from things such as power tools, audio systems inconsiderately played
                        at high volume or even raised voices.</para>
                  
                        <para>The standards do not address environmental noise through the <link

                                    absorptive material hung in the wall cavity will absorb mid to

                        a wall or floor for example) increases. This also varies with the direction
                        of the sound waves, and is usually assumed to be the average for all

                        perceived as a result of direct transmission. Flanking transmission can
                        occur, for instance, when a wall abuts the face of the inner leaf of an
                        external cavity wall, and the walls are insufficiently tied or bonded
                        together, thus allowing the noise to travel along the inner leaf.</para>

                        as audio and TV are now used. Noise generated by people in hotel corridors
                        as they move about and bang doors or talk loudly can cause disturbance to

                    <para>Complaints regarding noisy services are made regularly. Dealing with the
                        varying levels of sound produced by service equipment, such as lifts, heat
                        pumps or air conditioning units in <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> is a complex task, and not an
                        issue specifically dealt with here. However guidance is given on special
                        care that should be taken at the decision stage in the choice of service
                        equipment, their installation and location within the <link

                    <para>Designers should be aware that some Local Authorities' may also set noise
                        reduction targets.  This is usually enforced through environmental health
                        and planning legislation for noise emanating from non-domestic premises.

                        Scottish Ministers convened an expert panel to advise on the development of
                        a low carbon building standards strategy to increase energy efficiency and
                        reduce carbon emissions. This resulted in The Sullivan Report – ‘A Low

                        standards in 2010 and 2013, with the aim of net zero carbon buildings
                        (emissions for space heating, hot water, lighting and ventilation) in

                    <title>6.1.0 Introduction</title>
                    <para>Standard 6.1 focuses on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions arising
                        from the use of heating, hot water, ventilation and lighting in new
                        buildings and large extensions. The guidance sets an overall level for
                        maximum carbon dioxide emissions in buildings by use of a methodology which
                        incorporates a range of parameters that influence energy use. This means a
                        designer is obliged to consider energy performance as a complete package
                        rather than looking only at individual elements such as insulation or boiler

                        infiltration. If the same building was upgraded to 2002 levels of fabric

                        heat loss through infiltration could represent over 40% of total heat
                        losses. When addressing infiltration, the provision of adequate,

                        remain the aim, a flexible approach to improvement should be taken, based
                        upon investigation of the traditional construction, form and character of

                        Provisions under other legislation (e.g. planning consent for listed <link

                        or features) are also relevant. The manner in which proposed improvements
                        may affect moisture movement or the permeability of existing constructions
                        will also require assessment to address the risk of adverse
                        consequences.</para>
                    <para>For all <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                        >buildings</link>, it would be advisable to consider the feasibility of

                        6.2.11 (individual element U-values). In many cases, specialist advice will
                        help ensure that, in improving energy efficiency, there is no other, adverse
                        effect to the <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link> fabric.</para>
                    <para>Accordingly, each <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link> will have to be dealt with on its own merits.
                        Improvements to the fabric insulation of the <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> will often depend on factors
                        such as whether or not improvement <link linkend="work"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> can be carried out in a
                        non-disruptive manner without damaging existing fabric (for example,
                        insulating the ceiling of an accessible <link linkend="roof_space"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">roof space</link>), or whether potential
                        solutions are compatible with the existing construction.</para>
                    <para>In certain cases, <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >buildings</link> are given historic or listed status because of
                        specific features present in certain parts of the building. In these
                        circumstances, it may be possible to make greater improvements to other less
                        sensitive areas.</para>
                    <para>In all cases the ‘do nothing’ approach should not be considered initially.
                        Innovative but sympathetic and practical solutions to energy efficiency,
                        which are beyond the scope of this guidance, can often result in an
                        alternative package of measures being developed for a building. For example,
                        carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced without affecting <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> fabric
                        through improvements to the heating system (refer to Standards 6.3 and 6.4),
                        the lighting system (refer to Standard 6.5) or incorporation of low carbon
                        equipment (such as biomass boilers, heat pumps or CHP). Consultation on such
                        matters at an early stage with both the verifier and the planning officer of
                        the relevant authority is advised.</para>

                        alterations. The exception to this is at the junction between existing and
                        new building work, for example the need for proprietary metal ‘wall starter’
                        ties where the existing brickwork stops and new cavity blockwork begins.

                        (including heating and cooling elements) (MVAC), attention should therefore

                        approach explained in the guidance to Standard 6.1 allows designers the
                        flexibility to assign cooling only to those zones of an otherwise heated
                        only <link linkend="buildings">building</link>, where heating and cooling is

                        <para>Designers may wish to design beyond the current guidance and consider
                        the risks of higher internal temperatures occurring more often due to solar
                        gains. CIBSE Technical Memorandum 37 (TM37) ‘Design for Improved Solar
                        Shading Control'(<link xlink:href="http://www.cibse.org/"/>) gives guidance
                        on this issue.</para>
                 
                        <para>The designer should consider natural ventilation strategies
                        appropriate for the building geometry (which could include a combination of
                        brise soleil, natural ventilation controls and daylight controls).
                        Particular attention should be paid to limiting solar gains by ensuring that
                        areas of the external <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link> fabric which are susceptible to solar gain have
                        appropriate areas of solar shading. A ventilation strategy that incorporates
                        night cooling and the thermal mass of a <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> should also be
                        considered.</para>
                    <para>Free cooling should be optimised in order to minimise the need for
                        mechanical ventilation and air conditioning. When the external air
                        temperature is higher than the space temperature the system design should
                        allow the provision of a minimum level of fresh air. Enthalpy control should
                        also be considered to improve free cooling.</para>
                    <para>Should natural ventilation fail to achieve the required occupied period
                        temperature, the designer could consider mixed-mode ventilation. A
                        mixed-mode <link linkend="buildings">building</link> integrates the use of
                        air conditioning when and where it is necessary, with use of natural
                        ventilation whenever it is feasible or desirable, to maximise occupant
                        comfort whilst reducing energy use (compared to 'year round' use of air
                        conditioning). </para>

                        <para>It is proposed to form a 3m high extension onto an existing single

                        considers that it is easier to provide solar shading to slightly larger
                        windows. The existing <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"

                        no water services or plumbing element under proposed works, there is no need

                        practicality)</title>
                    <para>Improvement should be proportionate to the extent of proposed works. It is
                        recommended that the cost of improvement works should amount to
                        approximately <emphasis role="bold">5%</emphasis> of the cost of proposed
                        work. In this respect, assessment should be based upon cost of carrying out
                        improvement works, exclude any design or consultancy fees. Where proposed
                        improvements amount to less than this percentage, the applicant should, in
                        scheduling the assessment process, provide evidence to support any reduced
                        level of improvement.</para>
                    <para>It is the intent that improvement works proposed should be cost-effective,
                        with a short to medium payback period. Assessment need only consider
                        improvements that, when combined, have a payback period of <emphasis
                            role="bold">five years </emphasis>or less. The exception to this is the
                        replacement of a boiler or chiller unit, where near the end of its useful
                        life, as there will be additional cost benefit where replacing such
                        equipment as part of more extensive works.</para>
                    <para>The cost of any improvement works should be included in the estimated
                        value of works used to determine the level of building warrant fee. The
                        value of improvement works and proposed works should be identified
                        separately to allow the proportion of improvement works to be
                        verified.</para>
                    <para>Work to improve fixed building services should be neither overly
                        disruptive to the operation of the existing building nor require costly or
                        extensive intervention to the building fabric. However, it is recognised
                        that work chosen by the applicant (see clause 6.D.4) may be of such a
                        nature. Where such enabling work is required, it should not be counted as
                        part of the cost of improvement work.</para>

                        are identified, the applicant may propose alternative improvements where
                        they consider these more relevant to the building and can demonstrate that
                        such improvement will deliver broadly equivalent benefit.</para>
                    <para>Where an Energy Performance Certificate or similar assessment exists for
                        the building, it would be good practice to check any recommendations on
                        existing fixed building services amongst the cost-effective improvements
                        already identified.</para>
                    <para>For buildings with air conditioning systems, applicants should be aware of
                        the need for inspection of systems over 12kW under regulation 17 of the
                        Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 and, where applicable, should consider
                        instructing such an inspection where such systems are present. Information
                        from this report will assist in assessing potential improvement to such
                        systems under this Direction.</para>
                    <para>To maximize benefit to the building, improvements should meet current
                        performance levels recommended in the guidance to Standards 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
                        and 6.6 where this is reasonably practicable. Where not reasonably
                        practicable, for technical reasons or for reasons of cost or level of
                        disruption to the building, improvement should still be made to the extent
                        that can be achieved. The applicant should take advice on the impact which a
                        lower level of improvement may have on the cost effectiveness of such work
                        and may choose to not make such improvements where payback periods are
                        longer than five years. The case for this should be presented to the
                        verifier.</para>

                    <title>6.D.5 Review by verifier</title>
                    <para>The primary role of the verifier is to check that the process outlined
                        above is observed and that proposed improvements to existing building
                        services are of a scale appropriate to the proposed works or, if not, that
                        substantiation for a reduced level of improvement is provided and is
                        justifiable.</para>
                    <para>Whilst the verifier may question the extent of proposals and request
                        further evidence to support such enquiries, it is not expected that they
                        should direct the types of improvement which are to be carried out for a
                        particular case.</para>
                    <para>On acceptance of proposals by the verifier, works arising under this
                        Direction are subject to the same process as all other works requiring a
                        building warrant, where the responsibility of the relevant person/applicant
                        is to carry out works in accordance with the issued building warrant and the
                        requirements of the building regulations in general. The verifier will make
                        reasonable enquiry to establish this, prior to accepting a completion
                        certificate.</para>

                    <title>6.D.6 The role of the Local Authority</title>
                    <para>Due to the checking integral to the building warrant process, the local
                        authority should generally have no direct role in this process other than as
                        verifier. However, under section 25 of the Act, the local authority may
                        serve a building regulations compliance notice on the building owner, if the
                        improvement work is not carried out. Where the building owner fails to
                        comply with the notice they are guilty of an offence.</para>
                    <para>However, it should be noted that, if none of the proposed building warrant
                        work is carried out on the building, no improvement work to existing fixed
                        building services need be carried either.</para>

                    <para>The performance of components in installations less than 13 years old
                        (post 4 March 2002) need not be improved further where the minimum
                        performance meets levels set within building regulations. The intent of this
                        limitation is to avoid replacement of elements where installations are both
                        recent and relatively energy efficient as this will generally be less
                        cost-effective.</para>
                    <para>Applicants should note that, as a wider range of building services issues
                        are now addressed within building regulations (an example in 2010 being the
                        introduction of a minimum efficiency for circulators and pumps), it will be
                        necessary to measure performance of some elements against the current
                        edition of the standards, where a level of performance is not identified in
                        previous editions of the building regulations.</para>

                    <para>A primary school building, completed in 2000 is being extended to acquire
                        a new staff room. The estimated value of the new work is £50,000. Proposed
                        works include power, lighting, heating and ventilations systems. The
                        capacity of the existing boilers is sufficient to cater for the heating and
                        hot water requirements of the extension. The building already has an EPC
                        which offers recommendations for cost-effective improvement.</para>
                    <para>After further assessment of the fixed building services in the existing
                        school, the following improvement measures are identified: <itemizedlist>

                                    £244 giving a payback period of 7 years. </para>

                                    period of 3.5 years. </para>

                        </itemizedlist></para>
                    <para>The third option (installation of the daylight sensors) has a short
                        payback period and a higher annual fuel cost saving which may make it the
                        preferred option in isolation, if there were no preference for the type of
                        improvement to be carried out in the existing building.</para>
                    <para>The combined cost of the two first options is £2,500, with a total annual
                        fuel saving of £488 and a (combined) 5.6 year payback and therefore could
                        qualify if the slightly long payback period is acceptable.</para>
                    <para>In this case, the building owner is advised that the saving from combining
                        daylight sensors and T5 retrofit would be reduced (as sensors would act to
                        improve a lighting load already reduced by the T5 retrofit) and, having
                        experienced increased heating bills over recent years, elects to improve the
                        performance of the heating system instead of installing sensors. On that
                        basis, the first two improvement options, which constitute around 5% of the
                        proposed value of works, are scheduled as part of the submission to the

                        a café at a cost of £55,000. The existing building services are to be
                        extended to supply the new café. The building already has an EPC which
                        offers recommendations for cost-effective improvement. The building contains
                        an air conditioning system over 12kW and an inspection of the system and
                        report was prepared previously. The report includes some minor

                        (installation of variable speed drives), while within the identified 5% cost
                        margin, has an unrealistically long payback period which would not make it a
                        suitable choice for improvement.</para>
                    <para>The remaining improvement item has a short payback period and amounts to
                        less than 5% of the proposed value of works. The recommendations to improve
                        the air conditioning systems are low cost but would contribute to assessment
                        under the Direction.</para>
                    <para>The building owners choose to implement the second option (replacing GLS
                        with CFL) which has a short payback period and a high annual fuel cost
                        saving, even though the initial cost is below the identified 5% works cost.
                        They also identify improvement to the air conditioning system and the small
                        cost this incurs. As works remain below the identified 5% works cost,
                        evidence is provided to show that no other cost-effective improvements are
                        applicable to the building. Proposed work and evidence of further assessment
                        carried out are scheduled as part of the submission to the verifier.</para>

                    <para>The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 allows Scottish Ministers to regulate for
                        the purpose of furthering the achievement of sustainable development. In
                        Scotland, sustainability is embedded into the building regulations for all
                        new buildings, rather than reference being made to new buildings achieving
                        levels within a voluntary system. Since 2005, progress has been made by
                        strengthening the standards on, for example, energy efficiency and
                        accessibility for all new buildings so they are comparable with the best in
                        Europe.   </para>
                    <para>Whilst the standards within Sections 1 - 6 of the 2013 Technical Handbooks
                        deliver a level of sustainability in a number of areas such as energy and
                        surface water drainage, there is always the possibility of going beyond the
                        minimum standard. Scottish Ministers consider that it is not practicable at
                        this time to require every building to incorporate higher performance
                        standards or further sustainability measures. However, developers may wish
                        to gain recognition for building to higher standards. Additionally,
                        organisations such as planning authorities or funding bodies may choose to
                        make constructing to a higher level of sustainability a condition of
                        approval or funding.</para>
                    <para>Defining higher standards to measure sustainability will enable higher
                        quality buildings to be created and for such benefits to be formally
                        recognised. The continued development of Section 7 is the next step in
                        encouraging the sustainable design and construction of all new buildings
                        within a broader context of sustainable development. Further reductions in
                        carbon dioxide (CO<subscript>2</subscript>) emissions from new buildings
                        will also assist in meeting targets within the Climate Change (Scotland) Act
                        2009.   </para>
                    <para>On 1st of May 2011, Sustainability labelling was introduced to the
                        Scottish Building Standards through the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 which
                        allows Ministers to make building regulations for the purpose of furthering
                        the achievement of sustainable development. Applicable to all new buildings,
                        the principles build upon the degree of sustainability already embedded
                        within the building regulations. </para>

                                    Sections 1 - 6 of the building regulations. This will emphasise
                                    that a degree of sustainable design and construction is not a
                                    niche market but must be achieved in all new buildings </para>

                       <para>There are areas currently considered inappropriate for
                        inclusion in the optional upper levels for new buildings due to the
                        complexity of some subjects related to building design and construction,
                        such as material sourcing and embodied energy. However the Sullivan Report
                        ('A Low Carbon Building Standards Strategy for Scotland'; published by
                        Scottish Ministers in 2007) recommends total-life zero carbon buildings by
                        2030. This section can respond in due course to the growing relative
                        importance of embodied energy as the performance of new buildings improves
                        further. At present these areas are outside the scope of this standard.

                    <para>Schools in particular occupy a central place within a community or
                        neighbourhood. Therefore the concept of a ‘sustainable school’ as a whole
                        will reach out beyond the site boundary and include better and safer active
                        travel routes to and from a school. It is clear that location is outwith the
                        remit of building standards but this part of sustainable design is addressed
                        in Scottish planning policy. The planning document ‘Designing Streets’
                        contains guidance that should be applied when the connections between
                        schools and the places they inhabit are being considered and designed.

                    <para>The statement of sustainability (sustainability label, or SL) that
                        includes the level of sustainability achieved must be fixed to the building
                        prior to completion. The sustainability label should be indelibly marked and
                        located in a position that is readily accessible, protected from weather and
                        not easily obscured. A suitable location could be in a plant room or the
                        owner may choose to display the label in a more prominent location. An
                        example of an approved label is given in Annex G. A program to generate such
                        a label that is specific to a <link linkend="buildings">building</link> is

                        </itemizedlist>The award of a sustainability label at the upper levels would
                        depend upon meeting all 8 aspects. Aspects cannot be traded-off to achieve a

                        integrated design. The following optional upper levels are only available
                        for school buildings containing classrooms as defined within clauses 7.1.5 –

                        welcomed. For example, a new building could have a sustainability label at
                        Bronze Active level, which also indicates that a Gold level has been
                        achieved in the aspect of carbon dioxide emissions. This achievement would

                    <para> Optional upper levels of sustainability for a school building containing
                        classrooms should be selected from the following, defined within clauses

                        <para>The aim is for balance in the setting of upper levels because
                        sustainability is considered in the round rather than focusing on issues of
                        energy or carbon emissions. Reaching upper levels should be a valid target
                        for any new development, regardless of size or location. Generally, levels
                        have been set to avoid individual aspects that could upset applications
                        which might otherwise meet all of the other aspects of sustainability.   </para>
                    <para>The first optional upper level ‘Silver’ offers substantial benefits in a
                        range of sustainability aspects which should be achievable by most new
                        schools. The second optional upper level ‘Gold’ is a more demanding target,
                        initially aimed at those intent on pursuing best practice. </para>
                    <para>School buildings that exceed a Gold sustainability level are also
                        welcomed. A third upper level called 'Platinum' has been reserved for
                        further recognition within the building standards system. At present, only
                        the aspect of carbon dioxide emissions has been defined for this level.   </para>
                    <para>School buildings that exceed Bronze, Bronze Active, Silver, Silver Active
                        or Gold levels by achieving a higher level criteria in one or more of the
                        aspects are welcome and reflected on the sustainability label. However, the
                        achievement of the next upper level (Platinum) will only be recognised once
                        all aspects of that particular level have been included. The award of an
                        overall upper level depends upon meeting all aspects rather than allowing
                        trade-offs to achieve a score, reinforcing the fact that sustainable
                        outcomes rely on holistic integrated design. </para>

                                    However, a significant proportion of energy is used for the

                    <para>Solar shading should be designed to reduce summer time overheating and
                        allow passive solar gain during winter months. Effective solar shading
                        design should not reduce natural lighting within a room to the extent that
                        artificial lighting is required.  External shading devices are the most
                        effective as they deflect solar radiation before it enters the building. </para>
                    <para>Horizontal devices on south facades provide the most effective shading
                        without compromising natural daylight, however this type of measure is not
                        suitable for east and west facades as the angle of the sun is too low.
                        Vertical fins and adjustable devices such as sliding and rotating shutters
                        are best suited to east and west facades. For optimum indoor thermal comfort
                        designers should consider combining effective solar shading with night time
                        cooling through the use of inward opening hopper windows or vents.</para>

                    <para> The information within the user information guide should be concise and
                        compact and presented where possible with graphics to aid rapid
                        comprehension. Utilising this approach therefore means it is more likely to
                        be kept available, used for future reference and represented as new pupils
                        are introduced to a school.   </para>
                    <para>The guide should be accessible to all, using diagrams and coloured
                        presentations. Information should be available in digital format to allow it
                        to be made available as a digital booklet and able to be stored online on a
                        central server perhaps to be used as a mobile application, a digital
                        information board or server screen savers or part of a home screen where
                        Wi-Fi is available.   </para>
                    <para>Key classrooms that are likely to be used for community or public
                        functions such as, sports halls, libraries or community rooms should have a
                        permanent display to inform occasional users on how to operate the building
                        effectively.    </para>
                    <para>The emphasis is to provide the information as a digital booklet. Where
                        printed copies are required, the recommended formats should be as a
                        booklet.</para>

                    <para> The guide should include plans, locating key items of equipment and
                        information only on the systems installed. The format should revolve around
                        simple illustrations following the principle – ‘show don’t tell’. An
                        illustration can be a hand-drawn sketch, a computer image or a photograph.
                        These can be mixed because consistency in style is less important than
                        content.  Illustrations do not need to be to scale, but should show
                        relationships and explain things quickly and easily. These guidelines should
                        be followed:</para>

                        if it has a number of components or options. Briefly describe how hot water
                        generation is controlled. Illustrate the controls, identify the reaction to
                        hot water controls (for example there may be a time lag before a hot water
                        system operates at optimum capacity) and outline the normal range if this is

                        overcast days) including any solutions to reduce glare. Describe how manual
                        or automatic controls for artificial lighting can reduce the likelihood of
                        artificial lights being used when they are not required.  Briefly describe
                        how any manual artificial lighting is controlled as well as illustrating
                        their location.  </para>

                <para>The Construction Products Regulation (CPR), in force in the UK on 1 July 2013,
                    permits the use of a wide range of standards and specifications recognised
                    throughout the European Economic Area (EEA) (see Note 1). </para>
                <para>Standards of safety, suitability and fitness measured against factors common
                    throughout Europe are intended to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade. The
                    European standards body (CEN), see clause 0.8.2, produce harmonised European
                    Standards (EN) to replace the variety of standards used throughout Member States
                    (see Note 2). These ENs have been or will be published in the UK by the British
                    Standards Institution (BSI) as a BS EN. Once a BS EN is published, the old BS
                    will co-exist for a transitional period (usually 1 year) with the corresponding
                    BS. Until the BS EN comes into force during which both BS and BS EN may be
                    referenced. At the end of the transitional period the BS is withdrawn and the BS
                    EN must be adopted.</para>
                <para>The complex processes involved in the production of European Standards can
                    create lengthy development times. European Standards in draft form are termed
                    prEN and are released into the public domain when they are issued for
                    consultation. It has been found necessary, occasionally, to reference prEN in
                    the Technical Handbooks where no other suitable document yet exists.</para>
                <para>Any reference in the Technical Handbooks to a British Standard (BS), British
                    Standard Code of Practice (CP), European Standard (BS EN or prEN) or
                    International Standard (BS EN ISO) is to a standard published by BSI. Where a
                    revision or a newer standard has since been produced, this newer version may be
                    used as an alternative, unless otherwise stated in the handbooks. Any reference
                    in the handbooks to a particular requirement or recommendation of such a
                    standard should be taken, unless the context otherwise requires, as including
                    reference to any relevant commentary and defined terminology contained in that
                    standard. Attention is also drawn to the status accorded to standards and
                    specifications recognised elsewhere in the EEA which provide an equivalent
                    standard – see the guidance to Regulation 8, Materials, durability and
                    workmanship. Compliance with the standards contained in publications in this
                    category represent compliance with the appropriate standards referred to
                    elsewhere in the handbooks and is acceptable until a relevant harmonised
                    standard is introduced.</para>
                <para>Harmonised test methods have been agreed collectively by Member States and CEN
                    on the basis of the implications of health and safety of the product and on the
                    particular nature and production process for the product itself. Certification,
                    inspection and testing of construction products is carried out by notified
                    bodies who have been appointed for the purpose by a Member State and whose name
                    has been notified to the European Commission. The British Board of Agrément
                    (BBA) is a notified body for certain products. Any reference in the handbooks to
                    a certificate issued by a notified body or to a BBA Certificate should be
                    construed as reference to the current certificate.</para>
                <para>Any reference in the handbooks to a publication should be construed as a
                    reference to that publication as detailed in Column 1 of the list of
                    publications given in this Appendix, subject to such amendments, supplements or
                    addenda as are detailed in the list.</para>
                <para>Where a publication referred to in the handbooks itself refers to another
                    publication, the reference to such other publication should be considered to be
                    a reference to the latest edition including any amendments, supplements or
                    addenda.</para>
                <para>Where the standards listed in this Appendix have been amended or replaced
                    since the publication of the handbooks, it is no longer necessary to await the
                    publication of updated guidance. The verifier can accept a design to the new
                    standard if it considers the relevant expanded functional standard is
